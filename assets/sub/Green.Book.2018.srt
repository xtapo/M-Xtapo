84
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,178
I don't know.

85
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,849
Maybe go work
at my uncle's pizza joint.

See you, Carmine.

91

No, you shouldn't...
that should not happen.

My hat.

94
00:05:13,304 --> 00:05:17,006
Heard it was missing,
so I looked into it.

95
00:05:17,008 --> 00:05:18,941
I wanted to kill that broad.

96
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,242
No, no. It wasn't her fault.

97
00:05:20,244 --> 00:05:23,079
Who had the balls
to clip Gio's hat?

98
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:24,680
Don't worry about it.
I took care of it.

99
00:05:24,682 --> 00:05:27,149
Yeah, I hope you gave him
some beating.

It was a pleasure,
Mr. Loscudo, really.

00:08:13,384 --> 00:08:15,251
The curve is hit
deep into right field...

166
00:08:19,557 --> 00:08:23,392
We did it! We got it!

167
00:08:23,394 --> 00:08:24,460
- Yeah!
- There it is!

168
00:08:26,097 --> 00:08:27,296
- All right.
- Three-one, baby. Three-one.

169
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:30,332
- Coming back.
- Roger, baby, way to go!

170
00:08:30,334 --> 00:08:32,134
- Three-one.
- Way to go!

171
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,670
Do it again.
Let's do it again.

172
00:08:34,672 --> 00:08:36,272
Come on, baby.

173
00:08:36,274 --> 00:08:37,373
No, Tony.

174
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,477
Go get dressed.
We're gonna eat.

175
00:08:41,112 --> 00:08:42,311
All right.

176
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,547
No game seven, no game seven.

177
00:08:55,393 --> 00:08:57,693
From thy bounty,
through Christ, our Lord.

178
00:08:57,695 --> 00:09:00,696
- Amen.
- Amen.

179
00:09:00,698 --> 00:09:04,266
And if anyone hears of a job
for Tony, let us know.

180
00:09:04,268 --> 00:09:05,734
- Dolor.
- What?

181
00:09:05,736 --> 00:09:07,469
Please.

182
00:09:07,471 --> 00:09:09,204
What happened? You get fired?

183
00:09:09,206 --> 00:09:10,439
- No.
- No.

184
00:09:10,441 --> 00:09:12,141
The Copa's closing for repairs,

185
00:09:12,143 --> 00:09:14,111
so he just needs something
for a couple of months.

186
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:25,454
All the people he knows, he'll
find something in no time.

187
00:09:25,456 --> 00:09:28,724
Well, he had a great job
at the Sanitation Department.

188
00:09:28,726 --> 00:09:30,693
You shouldn't have punched out
the foreman.

189
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,661
He shouldn't have woke me up.

190
00:09:34,565 --> 00:09:36,933
That's Tony.

191
00:09:36,935 --> 00:09:38,534
I can't believe they lost.

192
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,469
- Don't worry, don't worry.
- Relax.

193
00:09:44,508 --> 00:09:46,275
That never happened before.

194
00:09:46,277 --> 00:09:48,277
They're gonna win
the World Series.

195
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,753
I'm telling you,
this is gonna be

196
00:09:57,755 --> 00:09:59,722
the easiest 50 bucks
you're ever gonna make.

197
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:00,957
Yeah, we'll see.

198
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,492
Hey, there they are.

199
00:10:03,494 --> 00:10:05,194
Hi, Johnny.

200
00:10:05,196 --> 00:10:06,362
- Tony, how are you?
- Hey, Paulie.

201
00:10:06,364 --> 00:10:08,430
- How you doing?
- I'm good, I'm good.

202
00:10:08,432 --> 00:10:10,265
So, uh, Johnny here
tells me you ate

203
00:10:10,267 --> 00:10:12,434
48 White Castle burgers
all in one sitting.

204
00:10:12,436 --> 00:10:14,269
Cheeseburgers.

205
00:10:14,271 --> 00:10:15,671
You tell him, Frankie.

206
00:10:15,673 --> 00:10:16,806
I don't believe it.

207
00:10:16,808 --> 00:10:19,274
What do we care
if you believe it?

208
00:10:19,276 --> 00:10:20,509
Hey, Gorman.

209
00:10:20,511 --> 00:10:22,544
What's the record here
for hot dogs?

210
00:10:22,546 --> 00:10:25,247
18, Fat Paulie.

211
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,548
Why wasn't Lip in
on that contest?

212
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,583
What contest?

213
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,284
I was hungry.

214
00:10:29,286 --> 00:10:31,320
Well,
the bet's simple.

215
00:10:31,322 --> 00:10:33,689
Half a C-note.
Most hot dogs in an hour wins.

216
00:10:33,691 --> 00:10:35,326
With toppings.

217
00:10:36,828 --> 00:10:39,395
- What the hell you weigh?
- 260.

218
00:10:39,397 --> 00:10:41,430
Hey, two...
Your left ass weighs 260.

219
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:44,000
May my mother-in-law drop dead
on the spot if I'm lying.

220
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,271
- All right. You're on.
- Good.

221
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:52,842
Pick it up, Lip!

222
00:10:52,844 --> 00:10:55,611
The baby elephant just hit 19!

223
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,479
Let's go, Lip! Let's go!

224
00:10:57,481 --> 00:10:59,715
Come on, let's go, Lip!
Let's get this going!

225
00:10:59,717 --> 00:11:01,583
You're embarrassing!

226
00:11:01,585 --> 00:11:03,820
You're embarrassing your son!

227
00:11:03,822 --> 00:11:06,290
He is killing you!

228
00:11:13,564 --> 00:11:15,364
Hey, Nicky,
you doing your homework?

229
00:11:15,366 --> 00:11:17,033
- Yep.
- Good.

230
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,836
Where you been?

231
00:11:19,838 --> 00:11:21,670
Gorman's.

232
00:11:21,672 --> 00:11:23,739
I'm making dinner.

233
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,509
Fat Paulie bet me 50 bucks

234
00:11:27,511 --> 00:11:29,344
he could eat
more hot dogs than me.

235
00:11:29,346 --> 00:11:30,779
He knocked off 24.

236
00:11:30,781 --> 00:11:32,514
Guy's an animal.

237
00:11:32,516 --> 00:11:33,782
Are you crazy?

238
00:11:33,784 --> 00:11:35,517
You lost $50?

239
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,823
Dolores, please.

240
00:11:39,457 --> 00:11:40,758
I ate 26.

241
00:11:45,563 --> 00:11:48,297
You are so lucky.

242
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:49,665
You know that?

243
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,433
Rent is due on Monday.

244
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,775
You gonna get that?

245
00:12:00,444 --> 00:12:02,544
- Yeah?
- Hey, Lip.

246
00:12:02,546 --> 00:12:04,580
Some guy called over here.
A doctor.

247
00:12:04,582 --> 00:12:06,415
He's looking for a driver.

248
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:08,350
- You interested?
- Yeah.

249
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,920
They're interviewing guys
tomorrow afternoon.

250
00:12:10,922 --> 00:12:15,925
The address is, uh,
881 7th Avenue.

251
00:12:15,927 --> 00:12:17,827
2:15.

252
00:12:37,581 --> 00:12:39,548
Hey. Excuse me.

253
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,350
We're not open right now,
but you're welcome

254
00:12:41,352 --> 00:12:43,385
to purchase tickets
to tonight's performance.

255
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,553
Nah, that's all right.

256
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,856
I, uh... I think
I got the wrong address,

257
00:12:46,858 --> 00:12:49,625
but, uh, is there
a doctor's office in here?

258
00:12:49,627 --> 00:12:50,960
A doctor's office?

259
00:12:50,962 --> 00:12:52,694
Dr. Shirley?

260
00:12:52,696 --> 00:12:54,429
You have the correct address.

261
00:12:54,431 --> 00:12:56,634
Dr. Shirley lives upstairs,
above the Hall.

262
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:03,875
How you doing?

263
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,654
I'm here for the driver job.

264
00:13:17,688 --> 00:13:19,456
Tony Lip.

265
00:13:20,524 --> 00:13:22,892
No Tony Lip.

266
00:13:22,894 --> 00:13:25,394
No, I should be on there.

267
00:13:25,396 --> 00:13:27,563
Uh...

268
00:13:27,565 --> 00:13:31,600
no, um, I have a Tony Val...
Valle-la-la...

269
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,468
Vallelonga. Yeah.

270
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,805
That's me.

271
00:13:35,807 --> 00:13:37,472
Fill it out while you wait.

272
00:13:37,474 --> 00:13:38,674
What?

273
00:13:38,676 --> 00:13:40,742
Fill it out while you wait.

274
00:13:40,744 --> 00:13:42,680
Oh. Yeah.

275
00:14:04,836 --> 00:14:06,503
Have a seat.

276
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,599
Mr. Vallelonga.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

277
00:14:37,601 --> 00:14:38,968
Oh.

278
00:14:40,537 --> 00:14:42,071
I'm Dr. Donald Shirley.

279
00:14:42,073 --> 00:14:43,806
Tony.

280
00:14:43,808 --> 00:14:46,610
Yes. Please sit down.

281
00:14:49,247 --> 00:14:52,015
Some place you got here.

282
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:54,050
Are them horns real?

283
00:14:54,052 --> 00:14:56,654
Elephant tusks, yes.

284
00:14:57,721 --> 00:14:59,022
What about that?

285
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:00,658
Is that a molar?

286
00:15:01,993 --> 00:15:03,492
A what?

287
00:15:03,494 --> 00:15:05,794
A molar, a-a shark tooth.

288
00:15:05,796 --> 00:15:08,264
Or a tiger's, maybe.

289
00:15:08,266 --> 00:15:10,833
It was a gift.

290
00:15:10,835 --> 00:15:13,803
I thought, uh... I thought
I was going to an office.

291
00:15:13,805 --> 00:15:16,705
They said a doctor
needed a driver.

292
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,041
That's all they told you?

293
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:19,775
Yeah.

294
00:15:19,777 --> 00:15:23,712
Actually, it's a bit more
complicated than that.

295
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,917
Have you ever driven
professionally before?

296
00:15:26,952 --> 00:15:28,750
Yeah. Sanitation.

297
00:15:28,752 --> 00:15:30,519
Garbage trucks.

298
00:15:30,521 --> 00:15:33,089
Plus, I drive my boss home
at night.

299
00:15:33,091 --> 00:15:34,924
But I can drive anything.

300
00:15:34,926 --> 00:15:36,993
Limos. Tow trucks.

301
00:15:36,995 --> 00:15:38,694
Snowplows. Whatever.

302
00:15:38,696 --> 00:15:39,862
I see.

303
00:15:39,864 --> 00:15:41,797
What other experience
do you have?

304
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:43,532
I worked a lot of joints.

305
00:15:43,534 --> 00:15:45,802
Wagon Wheel,
Peppermint Lounge, Copa.

306
00:15:45,804 --> 00:15:47,602
In what capacity?

307
00:15:47,604 --> 00:15:48,805
What do you mean?

308
00:15:48,807 --> 00:15:50,739
What did you do there?

309
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,476
Uh...

310
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,144
Public relations.

311
00:15:55,146 --> 00:15:58,915
Well, first of all, Tony,
I'm not a medical doctor.

312
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:00,116
I'm a musician.

313
00:16:00,118 --> 00:16:02,551
You mean, like, songs?

314
00:16:02,553 --> 00:16:03,785
Yes.

315
00:16:03,787 --> 00:16:05,754
And I'm about to embark
on a concert tour,

316
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,689
the majority of which
will be down south.

317
00:16:07,691 --> 00:16:08,925
Atlantic City.

318
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:10,093
No.

319
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:11,760
The Deep South.

320
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,695
First, we're starting
in the Midwest,

321
00:16:13,697 --> 00:16:15,098
and then we're taking
a hard left.

322
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,100
Kentucky, North Carolina,
Tennessee,

323
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:19,068
and on down through the Delta.

324
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:22,138
Do you foresee any issues
in working for a black man?

325
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,340
No.

326
00:16:24,342 --> 00:16:25,908
No, no, no.

327
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,977
It was just the other day,
me and the wife

328
00:16:27,979 --> 00:16:30,015
had a couple of colored guys
over at the house.

329
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,050
For-for drinks.

330
00:16:34,052 --> 00:16:35,617
Hmm. I see.

331
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:36,785
You're married.

332
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,090
Yeah. Two kids.

333
00:16:40,925 --> 00:16:43,692
I'm not sure this is the
proper job for a married man.

334
00:16:43,694 --> 00:16:45,694
Why? Are we bringing broads?

335
00:16:45,696 --> 00:16:49,165
My point is we'll be gone
for eight straight weeks.

336
00:16:49,167 --> 00:16:51,834
No breaks,
right up until Christmas.

337
00:16:51,836 --> 00:16:54,170
You're quite sure you can leave
your family for that long?

338
00:16:54,172 --> 00:16:56,039
Depends what you're paying.

339
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,074
A hundred dollars a week,
plus room and board.

340
00:16:58,076 --> 00:16:59,175
Hmm.

341
00:16:59,177 --> 00:17:01,710
But let me be crystal clear.

342
00:17:01,712 --> 00:17:03,678
I'm not just hiring
a chauffeur.

343
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,816
I need someone
who can handle my itinerary.

344
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:09,651
Be a personal assistant.
I need a valet.

345
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:13,124
I need someone who can launder
my clothes and shine my shoes.

346
00:17:15,193 --> 00:17:17,062
Good luck, Doc.

347
00:17:19,763 --> 00:17:21,066
Tony.

348
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:27,970
I had my record label
ask around town

349
00:17:27,972 --> 00:17:29,906
to find me the right man.

350
00:17:29,908 --> 00:17:32,576
Your name came up
more than once.

351
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:36,846
You've impressed several people
with your...

352
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:38,917
innate ability
to handle trouble.

353
00:17:40,118 --> 00:17:42,051
And that is why I called
and inquired

354
00:17:42,053 --> 00:17:44,022
about your availability.

355
00:17:47,058 --> 00:17:48,690
Okay, here's the deal.

356
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,725
I got no problem
being on the road with you.

357
00:17:50,727 --> 00:17:51,861
But I ain't no butler.

358
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:53,762
I ain't ironing no shirts,

359
00:17:53,764 --> 00:17:55,131
and I'm not polishing
nobody's shoes.

360
00:17:55,133 --> 00:17:57,433
You need somebody to get you
from point A to point B?

361
00:17:57,435 --> 00:17:58,835
You need someone to make sure

362
00:17:58,837 --> 00:18:00,002
there's no problems
along the way?

363
00:18:00,004 --> 00:18:02,004
And believe me,
you and the Deep South,

364
00:18:02,006 --> 00:18:03,840
there's gonna be problems.

365
00:18:03,842 --> 00:18:05,108
So, if you want me,

366
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,143
it's a buck and a quarter
a week.

367
00:18:07,145 --> 00:18:09,744
Or go hire that little Chink
just pranced out of here.

368
00:18:09,746 --> 00:18:11,782
See how far you get.

369
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:16,751
Well, Mr. Vallelonga,

370
00:18:16,753 --> 00:18:19,088
thank you for stopping by.

371
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:33,269
Hey, Bobby.

372
00:18:33,271 --> 00:18:35,171
Give me a Rheingold.

373
00:18:35,173 --> 00:18:37,041
Ice cold.

374
00:18:46,017 --> 00:18:47,051
Mr. Tony.

375
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,719
Augie asking about you.

376
00:18:52,157 --> 00:18:53,890
Come on!
I'm dying of thirst over here.

377
00:18:53,892 --> 00:18:54,924
Shut up!

378
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:56,760
I'm talking.

379
00:18:59,497 --> 00:19:00,863
When?

380
00:19:00,865 --> 00:19:03,067
Now. He in his box.

381
00:19:29,194 --> 00:19:30,694
Tony Lip.

382
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,230
What the hell happened
at the Copa?

383
00:19:34,232 --> 00:19:36,167
I hear you almost split
a guy's face open.

384
00:19:37,335 --> 00:19:40,069
That guy you hit,
Mikey Cerrone,

385
00:19:40,071 --> 00:19:42,073
part of
Charlie the Hand's crew.

386
00:19:43,241 --> 00:19:45,243
Guess he should have
known better.

387
00:19:49,547 --> 00:19:51,847
Hand asked me to look into it.

388
00:19:51,849 --> 00:19:53,849
I spoke to Podell.

389
00:19:53,851 --> 00:19:57,055
Whole thing was, uh,
over a piece of ass, right?

390
00:19:58,189 --> 00:20:00,022
Yeah.

391
00:20:00,024 --> 00:20:03,792
Beef like that should never
happen inside the club.

392
00:20:03,794 --> 00:20:05,995
They were out of line.

393
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:07,999
So we squashed it.

394
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:12,969
You, uh, looking to earn
a little extra <i>scharole?</i>

395
00:20:12,971 --> 00:20:15,871
I can keep you busy
while the Copa is down.

396
00:20:15,873 --> 00:20:17,175
What do I gotta do?

397
00:20:19,143 --> 00:20:21,179
Things.

398
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,414
Appreciate it, but, uh,

399
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:27,917
I want to spend some time
with the family.

400
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,819
Don't be stupid.

401
00:20:29,821 --> 00:20:32,922
You make yourself a few extra
bucks, you buy something nice

402
00:20:32,924 --> 00:20:35,191
for that pretty little wife
of yours.

403
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:37,161
Hmm.

404
00:20:39,264 --> 00:20:41,197
Nah, I'm good.

405
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:43,167

♪ Lover's Island...

416
00:21:17,635 --> 00:21:19,335
So, come on.
I'm dying to hear.

417
00:21:19,337 --> 00:21:21,070
What happened
with the doctor interview?

418
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:23,072
He ain't a real doctor.

419
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:24,473
He's a piano player.

420
00:21:24,475 --> 00:21:26,342
Well, I don't understand.

421
00:21:26,344 --> 00:21:28,210
Why did they say
that he was a doctor?

422
00:21:28,212 --> 00:21:30,346
I don't know.
I think he's, like,

423
00:21:30,348 --> 00:21:32,882
a doctor of, uh,
piano playing or something.

424
00:21:32,884 --> 00:21:34,216
You can be that?

425
00:21:34,218 --> 00:21:35,885
I guess.

426
00:21:35,887 --> 00:21:38,154
He lives on top
of Carnegie Hall.

427
00:21:38,156 --> 00:21:40,022
You should've seen
this place, Dee.

428
00:21:40,024 --> 00:21:42,425
It was filled with statues
and all kinds of fancy crap.

429
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:44,960
And he was sitting on top
of a friggin' throne

430
00:21:44,962 --> 00:21:47,396
all dressed up like, uh, like
the king of the jungle bunnies.

431
00:21:47,398 --> 00:21:50,268
He's colored?

432
00:21:53,071 --> 00:21:55,104
Well, you wouldn't last
a week with him.

433
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:57,673
For the right money, I would.

434
00:22:07,251 --> 00:22:09,685
Yeah.

435
00:22:09,687 --> 00:22:11,287
Oh.

436
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:14,090
Look...

437
00:22:14,092 --> 00:22:15,958
Really?

438
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,159
- Uh, okay.
- You okay?

439
00:22:17,161 --> 00:22:18,461
Okay, hang on a sec.

440
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:22,698
It's, uh, Dr. Shirley,
the piano guy.

441
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,500
He wants to talk to you.

442
00:22:24,502 --> 00:22:26,168
- Me?
- Yeah.

443
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:27,970
What? No.

444
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:29,271
Come on.

445
00:22:29,273 --> 00:22:30,506
- Take it.
- No. Tony...

446
00:22:30,508 --> 00:22:32,143
Just... just talk.

447
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:37,014
Hello?

448
00:22:38,282 --> 00:22:40,383
Uh, good morning, Doctor.

449
00:22:40,385 --> 00:22:42,420
It's nice to talk to you.

450
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:50,128
Well, uh, yes,
that is a long time.

451
00:22:53,064 --> 00:22:54,365
It is.

452
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:58,267
Yes. I'm sure.

453
00:22:58,269 --> 00:23:00,202
Thank you.

454
00:23:00,204 --> 00:23:02,405
Thank you for calling.

455
00:23:02,407 --> 00:23:04,041
Bye, now.

456
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:08,279
What'd he say?

457
00:23:09,514 --> 00:23:11,547
He wanted to know
if I'd be okay

458
00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:16,419
with him taking my husband away
from his family for two months.

459
00:23:16,421 --> 00:23:19,924
He said he'd pay you
what you asked for.

460
00:23:24,996 --> 00:23:26,531
- Hey.
- Hmm?

461
00:23:28,332 --> 00:23:30,366
It's good money.

462
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:32,236
We need it.

463
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:38,242
Can't be eating 26 hot dogs
every day.

464
00:23:40,077 --> 00:23:42,578
I know.

465
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:45,918
I told him it was okay
for you to go.

466
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:50,419
All right, hey, look, so here's
the first half of your pay.

467
00:23:50,421 --> 00:23:52,354
You're gonna get the rest
when the tour's over.

468
00:23:52,356 --> 00:23:54,089
No, I gotta get paid
every week.

469
00:23:54,091 --> 00:23:56,091
Sorry. That's not how
the record company does it.

470
00:23:56,093 --> 00:23:58,260
We got to have some guarantee
you're gonna finish the job.

471
00:23:58,262 --> 00:24:01,163
Why wouldn't I finish the job?
I took it, didn't I?

472
00:24:01,165 --> 00:24:04,500
Well, then we got nothing
to worry about.

473
00:24:04,502 --> 00:24:07,169
Here's the deal,
Mr. Vallelonga.

474
00:24:07,171 --> 00:24:09,538
Okay, it's your job to get Don
to all his tour dates on time.

475
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,073
Now, if he misses any shows,

476
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:12,274
you're not getting
your back end.

477
00:24:12,276 --> 00:24:14,477
- He's not gonna miss any show.
- Good.

478
00:24:14,479 --> 00:24:17,246
Oh, you're gonna need this.

479
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:19,315
Now, this is the book
I was telling you about.

480
00:24:19,317 --> 00:24:21,383
Now, sometimes you guys
are staying in the same hotel,

481
00:24:21,385 --> 00:24:23,519
sometimes you're not.

482
00:24:23,521 --> 00:24:26,121
- Oh, yeah, the...
- Yeah, yeah.

483
00:24:26,123 --> 00:24:29,291
All right, don't let me down.
Let's go.

484
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,300
<i>Madonne,</i> is this the new one?

485
00:24:38,302 --> 00:24:40,302
Yeah, the record company
rented it.

486
00:24:40,304 --> 00:24:42,071
- It's nice, huh?
- Beautiful.

487
00:24:42,073 --> 00:24:43,672
So, what'd my sister
have to say

488
00:24:43,674 --> 00:24:45,674
about you being gone
for three weeks?

489
00:24:45,676 --> 00:24:48,077
Eight weeks.

490
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:49,846
Ten to one,

492
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,851
- Come here.
- All right, boys, huddle up.

493
00:24:54,853 --> 00:24:57,152
- Say good-bye to your father.
- Frankie, Nicky. Come here.

All right.

Yeah? All right, give me a kiss.

499

- Don't go too far.
- We won't.

500
00:25:11,435 --> 00:25:14,503
- Did you go to the AAA for the maps?
- Yes.

501
00:25:14,505 --> 00:25:17,172
No. I mean, the record
companies gave me the maps

502
00:25:17,174 --> 00:25:19,176
and the itinerary,
and this thing.

503

<i>The Negro Motorist's
Green Book.</i>

504
00:25:22,547 --> 00:25:25,548
Yeah, it lists all the places
coloreds can stay down south.

505
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:28,450
Like a... you know,
traveling while black.

506
00:25:28,452 --> 00:25:31,320
- "Traveling while black"?
- Yeah, if you're black

507
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:33,188
and you gotta travel,
for some reason.

508
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:36,191
- Got a special book for that?
- I guess.

509
00:25:36,193 --> 00:25:38,394
- Did you pack the iron?
- I ain't lugging no iron, Dee.

510
00:25:38,396 --> 00:25:40,529
- Come on.
- How are you gonna press your pants, Tony?

511
00:25:40,531 --> 00:25:43,198
I'll put 'em
under the mattress.

512
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,267
I want you
to write me a letter.

513
00:25:45,269 --> 00:25:47,336
- Every chance you get.
- I can't write letters.

514
00:25:47,338 --> 00:25:48,905
Yes, you can.

515
00:25:48,907 --> 00:25:50,472
- I can't write.
- Take you five minutes.

516
00:25:50,474 --> 00:25:51,607
- Promise me.
- It's embarrassing.

517
00:25:51,609 --> 00:25:53,409
It ain't gonna be no good.

518
00:25:53,411 --> 00:25:56,178
It's a lot cheaper than
calling long-distance, Tony.

519

Promise me you're gonna write.

520

00:33:19,924 --> 00:33:22,925
Guess we'll find out, huh?

653
00:33:22,927 --> 00:33:25,694
Hey, you know,
when you first hired me,

654
00:33:25,696 --> 00:33:28,064
my wife went out
and bought one of your records.

655
00:33:28,066 --> 00:33:30,199
The one about the orphans.

656
00:33:30,201 --> 00:33:31,934
Orphans?

657
00:33:31,936 --> 00:33:33,769
Yeah.

658
00:33:33,771 --> 00:33:36,774
Cover had a bunch of kids
sitting around a campfire.

659
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:39,077
Orpheus.

660
00:33:40,111 --> 00:33:41,743
Yeah.

661
00:33:41,745 --> 00:33:42,879
<i>Orpheus in the Underworld.</i>

662
00:33:42,881 --> 00:33:44,380
It's based on a French opera.

663
00:33:44,382 --> 00:33:46,883
And those weren't children
on the cover.

664
00:33:46,885 --> 00:33:49,751
Those were demons
in the bowels of hell.

665
00:33:49,753 --> 00:33:51,854
No shit.

666
00:33:51,856 --> 00:33:54,159
Must have been naughty kids.

667
00:34:08,106 --> 00:34:10,106
What are...
what are you doing?

668
00:34:10,108 --> 00:34:12,774
Gotta take a leak, Doc.

669
00:34:12,776 --> 00:34:14,811
Here? Now?

670
00:34:14,813 --> 00:34:17,013
You want me to piss my pants?

671
00:34:35,433 --> 00:34:37,601
♪ Whatcha gonna do?

672
00:35:34,926 --> 00:35:37,059
- Oh, hey, Doc.
- Good afternoon.

673
00:35:38,496 --> 00:35:40,963
Take this for any incidentals
we may need.

674
00:35:40,965 --> 00:35:43,732
If you want to buy something,
you don't have to ask.

675
00:35:43,734 --> 00:35:45,734
Just keep the receipts, please.

676
00:35:45,736 --> 00:35:47,803
When it runs low, let me know.

677
00:35:47,805 --> 00:35:49,105
Oh. Thanks.

678
00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:50,741
One more thing.

679
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:56,312
We'll be attending many events
before and after the concerts.

680
00:35:56,314 --> 00:35:58,047
Interacting
with some of the wealthiest

681
00:35:58,049 --> 00:36:00,917
and most highly educated people
in the country.

682
00:36:00,919 --> 00:36:03,219
It is my feeling
that your diction,

683
00:36:03,221 --> 00:36:05,821
however charming it may be
in the tristate area,

684
00:36:05,823 --> 00:36:08,224
could use some... finessing.

685
00:36:08,226 --> 00:36:11,728
You mean diction...
like in what way?

686
00:36:13,031 --> 00:36:15,066
Like in the only way
the word is ever used.

687
00:36:16,267 --> 00:36:18,367
- Okay.
- Your intonation, inflection,

688
00:36:18,369 --> 00:36:20,169
your choice of words.

689
00:36:20,171 --> 00:36:22,171
Hey, I got my own problems.

690
00:36:22,173 --> 00:36:24,040
Now I gotta worry
about what people think

691
00:36:24,042 --> 00:36:26,209
- about the way I talk?
- There are simple techniques

692
00:36:26,211 --> 00:36:28,844
I can teach you that are quite
effective. I can help you.

693
00:36:28,846 --> 00:36:30,379
I-I don't need no goddamn help.
People don't like

694
00:36:30,381 --> 00:36:32,817
the way I talk,
they can go take a shit.

695
00:36:33,851 --> 00:36:36,085
The profanity is another issue.

696
00:36:36,087 --> 00:36:38,287
Why are you breaking my balls?

697
00:36:38,289 --> 00:36:40,990
Because you can do better,
Mr. Vallelonga.

698
00:36:40,992 --> 00:36:43,226
Which brings me
to one more point.

699
00:36:43,228 --> 00:36:45,127
As the guest of honor,
I'll be introduced

700
00:36:45,129 --> 00:36:47,096
when entering
these intimate events.

701
00:36:47,098 --> 00:36:48,931
You will be introduced as well.

702
00:36:48,933 --> 00:36:51,033
In my humble opinion,

703
00:36:51,035 --> 00:36:54,003
"Vallelonga" may be difficult
to pronounce.

704
00:36:54,005 --> 00:36:56,239
So I was thinking...

705
00:36:56,241 --> 00:36:58,374
Valle would be more appropriate.

706
00:36:58,376 --> 00:37:01,143
Tony Valle. Short and sweet.

707
00:37:01,145 --> 00:37:02,211
Eh...

708
00:37:02,213 --> 00:37:03,379
nah.

709
00:37:03,381 --> 00:37:05,248
They got a problem
with Vallelonga,

710
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,983
they can call me Tony Lip.

711
00:37:06,985 --> 00:37:08,884
These are genteel people.

712
00:37:08,886 --> 00:37:11,254
"Tony the Lip" may be
a little...

713
00:37:11,256 --> 00:37:13,256
worldly for them.

714
00:37:13,258 --> 00:37:15,825
Well, then it's
Tony Vallelonga.

715
00:37:15,827 --> 00:37:19,128
All these high-class people,
so much smarter than me,

716
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:21,230
with their intelligence
and speaking abilities,

717
00:37:21,232 --> 00:37:23,165
you're telling me
they can't pronounce my name?

718
00:37:23,167 --> 00:37:25,268
They don't like it,
they can shove it up their ass.

719
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:27,272
I'll just wait outside.

720
00:37:28,306 --> 00:37:30,940
A sound compromise.

721
00:37:46,891 --> 00:37:48,991
Ladies and gentlemen,
tonight we are privileged

722
00:37:48,993 --> 00:37:53,129
to present
a great American artist.

723
00:37:53,131 --> 00:37:55,031
He gave his first
public performance

724
00:37:55,033 --> 00:37:56,232
at the age of three.

725
00:37:56,234 --> 00:37:57,933
At age 18,

726
00:37:57,935 --> 00:37:59,935
at Arthur Fiedler's invitation,

727
00:37:59,937 --> 00:38:02,305
our guest made
his concert debut

728
00:38:02,307 --> 00:38:04,273
with the Boston Pops.

729
00:38:04,275 --> 00:38:07,276
He holds doctorates
in psychology, in music

730
00:38:07,278 --> 00:38:09,879
and in the liturgical arts.

731
00:38:09,881 --> 00:38:12,014
And he has performed
at the White House twice

732
00:38:12,016 --> 00:38:13,649
in the past 14 months.

733
00:38:13,651 --> 00:38:16,285
He is a true virtuoso.

734
00:38:16,287 --> 00:38:18,087
- And it's a...
- "Virtuoso."

735
00:38:18,089 --> 00:38:21,023
- It's a special treat for me...
- That's Italian.

736
00:38:21,025 --> 00:38:24,427
Means, uh, means really good.

737
00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:27,096
So, ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome

738
00:38:27,098 --> 00:38:29,267
the Don Shirley Trio.

739
00:40:02,593 --> 00:40:04,393
A new pair of shoes!

740
00:40:06,197 --> 00:40:08,497
- Hard ten! Lady's friend.
- He keeps on winning!

741
00:40:08,499 --> 00:40:11,233
It's your dice.
I'm just having a lucky night.

742
00:40:11,235 --> 00:40:12,468
You cheating, brother!

743
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:15,237
- Tony.
- Get him again. Get him again.

744
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:17,306
- Boss man's calling.
- He ain't my boss.

745
00:40:17,308 --> 00:40:19,108
I work for the record company.

746
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:21,076
Yeah, I work
for the record company, too.

747
00:40:21,078 --> 00:40:22,478
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, come on, man.

748
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,547
Hey, give us a chance
to win back our loot, huh?

749
00:40:24,549 --> 00:40:26,215
I'm sorry, fellas, duty calls.

750
00:40:26,217 --> 00:40:28,317
- Come on, man.
- "Duty calls"?

751
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,553
My man, my duty is
to get my money back.

752
00:40:30,555 --> 00:40:32,555
I've been looking for you.

753
00:40:32,557 --> 00:40:35,624
Yeah, sorry. The guys
were having a little game.

754
00:40:35,626 --> 00:40:39,094
Next time you need
extra money, just ask me.

755
00:40:39,096 --> 00:40:40,596
It's more fun winning it.

756
00:40:40,598 --> 00:40:42,398
And what if you lost?

757
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,367
Grab some cards.
I don't lose, Doc.

758
00:40:45,369 --> 00:40:47,369
I don't lose.

759
00:40:47,371 --> 00:40:49,171
So stooping down in the gravel

760
00:40:49,173 --> 00:40:51,340
pitching dice for pocket change
makes you a winner?

761
00:40:51,342 --> 00:40:53,242
What are you
giving me shit for?

762
00:40:53,244 --> 00:40:55,110
Everybody was doing it.

763
00:40:55,112 --> 00:40:58,581
They didn't have a choice
whether to be inside or out.

764
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:00,451
You did.

765
00:41:03,554 --> 00:41:06,257
Now, wipe off your knees.
You have dirt on them.

766

Little Richard.

Really?
That's Little Richard?

Yeah.

788

I don't know.
Sounds fairly complicated.

789
00:42:30,441 --> 00:42:33,142
Got that right.

790
00:42:33,144 --> 00:42:35,644
So, where did this "Tony
the Lip" moniker come from?

791
00:42:35,646 --> 00:42:38,647
It's not Tony the Lip.

792
00:42:38,649 --> 00:42:41,317
It's Tony Lip. One word.

793
00:42:41,319 --> 00:42:43,652
I got it when I was kid,
'cause my friend said

794
00:42:43,654 --> 00:42:46,455
I was the best bullshit artist
in the Bronx.

that your friends,

the people closest to you,
consider you a liar?

799
00:42:54,765 --> 00:42:56,398
Who said "liar"?

800
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,534
I said "bullshit artist."

801
00:42:58,536 --> 00:43:00,269
And what's the difference?

802

'Cause I don't lie. Ever.

803

00:43:21,425 --> 00:43:23,258
Of course I've heard of him.

813
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:25,260
- I've just never heard his music before.
- I mean...

814
00:43:25,262 --> 00:43:27,529
But I like this.
This is nice.

815
00:43:27,531 --> 00:43:29,531
He's got a silky voice,
very smooth.

816
00:43:29,533 --> 00:43:31,266
Yeah, he's terrific.

817
00:43:31,268 --> 00:43:33,268
This is what everybody's
dancing to now.

818
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:34,605
- This stuff...
- Eyes on the road, Tony.

819
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,307
♪ Baby, here I am...

820
00:43:38,309 --> 00:43:39,642
You know this song.

821
00:43:39,644 --> 00:43:41,377
I don't think so, no.

822
00:43:41,379 --> 00:43:43,779
How could you
not know this music?

823
00:43:43,781 --> 00:43:45,982
Aretha Franklin.

824
00:43:45,984 --> 00:43:48,517
Chubby Checker,
Little Richard, Sam Cooke.

825
00:43:48,519 --> 00:43:52,221
I mean, come on, Doc.
These are your people.

826
00:43:52,223 --> 00:43:54,757
♪ And it won't be long

827
00:43:54,759 --> 00:43:56,694
♪ No, it won't be long...

828
00:44:05,569 --> 00:44:08,303
Do you want anything?
I'm getting a pack of smokes.

829
00:44:08,305 --> 00:44:10,174
No, thank you.

830
00:44:39,403 --> 00:44:41,437
Grabbed the rock
and put it in his pocket.

831
00:44:41,439 --> 00:44:42,806
Thank you, Oleg.

832
00:44:42,808 --> 00:44:44,373
Nice turtleneck.

833
00:44:44,375 --> 00:44:45,743
Way to mix it up.

834
00:44:48,612 --> 00:44:50,612
Got you an apple, Doc.

835
00:44:55,854 --> 00:44:59,423
Before we pull out, Tony,
we need to have a talk.

836
00:45:00,624 --> 00:45:02,058
Yeah?

837
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:03,792
Oleg told me what you did.

838
00:45:03,794 --> 00:45:05,461
What'd I do?

839
00:45:05,463 --> 00:45:07,696
You stole a jade stone
from the store.

840
00:45:07,698 --> 00:45:09,833
- No, I didn't.
- He watched you do it.

841
00:45:09,835 --> 00:45:11,734
I didn't steal no stone.

842
00:45:11,736 --> 00:45:13,669
You picked it up
and put it in your pocket.

843
00:45:13,671 --> 00:45:15,504
I picked up a rock
off of the ground.

844
00:45:15,506 --> 00:45:16,572
I didn't steal from a box.

845
00:45:16,574 --> 00:45:18,707
Now, why would you pick up
a rock off the ground?

846
00:45:18,709 --> 00:45:20,576
I don't know.

847
00:45:20,578 --> 00:45:22,578
'Cause it ain't stealing.

848
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:23,779
It's just a regular rock.

849
00:45:23,781 --> 00:45:25,748
And why would you want
a regular rock?

850
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:27,382
To have.

851
00:45:27,384 --> 00:45:29,085
For luck, maybe.

852
00:45:29,087 --> 00:45:30,385
A lucky rock.

853
00:45:30,387 --> 00:45:32,389
- Yeah.
- Let me see it.

854
00:45:43,734 --> 00:45:46,102
Mm-mm.

855
00:45:46,104 --> 00:45:48,537
Take it back and pay for it.

856
00:45:50,407 --> 00:45:52,541
I told you that kraut
was a snake.

857
00:45:52,543 --> 00:45:54,710
Rats me out for something
I didn't even do!

858
00:45:54,712 --> 00:45:56,813
Pay for the stone, Tony;
you'll feel better.

859
00:45:56,815 --> 00:45:59,916
I feel fine. And I ain't paying
for no regular rock

860
00:45:59,918 --> 00:46:02,484
I found in the dirt.

861
00:46:02,486 --> 00:46:05,687
Do not drive, Mr. Vallelonga.

862
00:46:07,859 --> 00:46:09,861
Put it back.

863
00:46:33,819 --> 00:46:36,418
- Feel better?
- No.

864
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:39,155
If you'd like, Tony,
I'd happily buy you the stone.

865
00:46:39,157 --> 00:46:42,591
Don't bother.
You took all the fun out of it.

866
00:47:19,197 --> 00:47:21,763
Excuse me. Sir.

867
00:47:21,765 --> 00:47:23,565
I'm with the band.

868
00:47:23,567 --> 00:47:24,700
You're all set up.

869
00:47:24,702 --> 00:47:26,903
This isn't the piano, right?

870
00:47:26,905 --> 00:47:28,204
That's it.

871
00:47:28,206 --> 00:47:29,906
It ain't a Steinway.

872
00:47:29,908 --> 00:47:31,640
So what?

873
00:47:31,642 --> 00:47:34,476
Dr. Shirley only plays
on Steinway grand pianos.

874
00:47:34,478 --> 00:47:36,511
It's in his written contract.

875
00:47:36,513 --> 00:47:37,779
Who's Dr. Shirley?

876
00:47:37,781 --> 00:47:40,049
Dr. Shirley.
The Don Shirley Trio.

877
00:47:40,051 --> 00:47:41,918
They're playing tonight.

878
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,652
Does it really matter?

879
00:47:43,654 --> 00:47:46,490
Yeah, it does.
It's in his contract.

880
00:47:47,791 --> 00:47:49,658
Come on, man.
Man, these coons

881
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:51,729
can play on anything
you put in front of them.

882
00:47:55,867 --> 00:47:57,666
But it's a piece of shit.

883
00:47:57,668 --> 00:47:59,668
And there's garbage in there.

884
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:01,570
So take it out.

885
00:48:01,572 --> 00:48:02,807
What'd you say?

886
00:48:03,909 --> 00:48:05,509
You heard me.

887
00:48:08,612 --> 00:48:10,712
Hey. You got two, three hours.

888
00:48:10,714 --> 00:48:12,748
Just get
a clean Steinway in here.

889
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:14,817
Oh, there ain't a Steinway
on campus.

890
00:48:14,819 --> 00:48:16,618
Not my problem.

891
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:18,021
I bet
there's not two Steinways

892
00:48:18,023 --> 00:48:19,688
in the whole state of Indiana.

893
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:21,925
I guess you'd better move
your ass, then.

894
00:48:21,927 --> 00:48:23,962
Who you think you're
talking to, greaseball?

895
00:48:53,925 --> 00:48:55,657
<i>Dear Dolores:</i>

896
00:48:55,659 --> 00:48:57,726
<i>This morning
I had steak and eggs</i>

897
00:48:57,728 --> 00:48:58,995
<i>for breakfast.</i>

898
00:48:58,997 --> 00:49:02,999
<i>The band has been playing
at very ritzy joints.</i>

899
00:49:03,001 --> 00:49:05,301
<i>Dr. Shirley and I
are getting along pretty good.</i>

900
00:49:05,303 --> 00:49:08,037
<i>But sometimes
I think he gets sad,</i>

901
00:49:08,039 --> 00:49:10,605
<i>and that's why
he drinks too much.</i>

902
00:49:10,607 --> 00:49:14,010
<i>I never knew how very beautiful
this country was.</i>

903
00:49:14,012 --> 00:49:16,545
<i>Now that I'm seeing it, I know.</i>

904
00:49:16,547 --> 00:49:18,714
<i>You won't believe
how beautiful nature is.</i>

905
00:49:18,716 --> 00:49:21,017
<i>It is as beautiful as they say.</i>

906
00:49:21,019 --> 00:49:23,886
<i>And the traffic out here
in the country is nothing,</i>

907
00:49:23,888 --> 00:49:25,787
<i>which is fine by me.</i>

908
00:49:25,789 --> 00:49:28,825
<i>Right now I'm eating spaghetti
and meatballs in a diner</i>

909
00:49:28,827 --> 00:49:32,561
<i>that tastes like ketchup
on Chinese noodles.</i>

910
00:49:32,563 --> 00:49:33,795
<i>We are heading down south now.</i>

911
00:49:33,797 --> 00:49:37,100
<i>I will write you another letter
when we get down south.</i>

912
00:49:37,102 --> 00:49:39,836
<i>I love you. Your husband, Tony.</i>

913
00:49:39,838 --> 00:49:41,871
<i>P.S. Kiss the kids for me.</i>

914
00:49:50,781 --> 00:49:52,348
Got any family, Doc?

915
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:53,883
Not really.

916
00:49:53,885 --> 00:49:56,653
Not really?
Either you do or you don't.

917
00:49:57,956 --> 00:50:00,023
It's a long story, Tony.

918
00:50:00,025 --> 00:50:03,192
What, we're in a hurry now?

919
00:50:03,194 --> 00:50:05,662
Let's hear it.

920
00:50:06,697 --> 00:50:08,797
I have a brother somewhere.

921
00:50:08,799 --> 00:50:11,767
We used to get together
once in a while,

922
00:50:11,769 --> 00:50:14,037
but it got more and more
difficult to stay in touch.

923
00:50:14,039 --> 00:50:17,373
Curse of being
a musician, I guess.

924
00:50:17,375 --> 00:50:19,809
Always on the road.

925
00:50:19,811 --> 00:50:21,911
Like a carnival worker.

926
00:50:21,913 --> 00:50:24,947
- Hmm.
- Or a criminal.

927
00:50:24,949 --> 00:50:27,616
Took quite the toll
on my marriage as well.

928
00:50:27,618 --> 00:50:29,218
- You're married?
- Was.

929
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:31,154
June.

930
00:50:31,156 --> 00:50:32,989
Good person.

931
00:50:32,991 --> 00:50:35,191
Terrible grammar,
but a kind soul.

932
00:50:35,193 --> 00:50:37,093
You'd quite like her.

933
00:50:37,095 --> 00:50:38,693
June.

934
00:50:38,695 --> 00:50:40,832
Like, uh, like Lassie's mom.

935
00:50:42,699 --> 00:50:45,201
Unfortunately,
I couldn't do a husband act

936
00:50:45,203 --> 00:50:47,702
and a concert pianist act.

937
00:50:47,704 --> 00:50:50,707
Couldn't seem to manage
both worlds.

938
00:50:52,844 --> 00:50:55,011
Kentucky Fried Chicken.

939
00:50:55,013 --> 00:50:56,711
In Kentucky!

940
00:50:56,713 --> 00:50:58,817
When's that ever gonna happen?

941
00:51:09,793 --> 00:51:12,128
All right!

942
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:13,830
Hey, you want some?

943
00:51:13,832 --> 00:51:15,832
I'm fine. Thank you, Tony.

944
00:51:15,834 --> 00:51:17,699
All right.

945
00:51:17,701 --> 00:51:22,004
Mmm. I think this is
the best Kentucky Fried Chicken

946
00:51:22,006 --> 00:51:23,940
I ever had.

947
00:51:23,942 --> 00:51:25,975
Probably 'cause it's fresher
down here, right?

948
00:51:25,977 --> 00:51:28,743
I don't think I've ever met
anyone with your appetite.

949
00:51:28,745 --> 00:51:31,114
No. I got the bucket
so you could have some.

950
00:51:31,116 --> 00:51:33,983
I've never had fried chicken
in my life.

951
00:51:33,985 --> 00:51:35,952
Who you bullshitting?

952
00:51:35,954 --> 00:51:37,854
You people love
the fried chicken,

953
00:51:37,856 --> 00:51:39,956
the grits
and the collard greens.

954
00:51:39,958 --> 00:51:42,757
I love it, too.
Negro cooks used to make it

955
00:51:42,759 --> 00:51:44,894
all the time
when I was in the Army.

956
00:51:44,896 --> 00:51:47,296
You have a very narrow
assessment of me, Tony.

957
00:51:47,298 --> 00:51:49,932
Yeah, right? I'm good.

958
00:51:49,934 --> 00:51:52,235
No. No, you're not good.
You're bad.

959
00:51:52,237 --> 00:51:54,270
I'm saying, just because
other Negroes enjoy

960
00:51:54,272 --> 00:51:56,939
certain types of music,
it doesn't mean I have to.

961
00:51:56,941 --> 00:51:59,774
- Nor do we all eat the same kind of food.
- Whoa.

962
00:51:59,776 --> 00:52:01,110
Wait a minute.

963
00:52:01,112 --> 00:52:03,112
If you said
all guineas like pizza

964
00:52:03,114 --> 00:52:05,314
and spaghetti and meatballs,
I'm not gonna get insulted.

965
00:52:05,316 --> 00:52:07,049
You're missing the point.

966
00:52:07,051 --> 00:52:09,185
For you to make the assumption
that every Negro...

967
00:52:09,187 --> 00:52:11,287
- Hey, you want some or not?
- No.

968
00:52:11,289 --> 00:52:13,055
Here. Come on.

969
00:52:13,057 --> 00:52:14,857
- Tell me that don't smell good.
- It...

970
00:52:14,859 --> 00:52:16,758
- Huh?
- It smells okay.

971
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,929
I prefer not to get grease
on my blanket.

972
00:52:19,931 --> 00:52:22,064
Ooh, I'm gonna get
grease on my blankey.

973
00:52:22,066 --> 00:52:24,100
Come on, have a piece.
It ain't gonna kill you.

974
00:52:24,102 --> 00:52:25,935
- Come on, take it, eat it.
- No.

975
00:52:25,937 --> 00:52:28,070
Take it.
I'm throwing it in the back.

976
00:52:28,072 --> 00:52:30,206
- You... Don't you dare.
- Then you better take it.

977
00:52:30,208 --> 00:52:32,942
How? Do you have plates
or utensils?

978
00:52:32,944 --> 00:52:34,310
Eat it with your hands!

979
00:52:34,312 --> 00:52:36,078
- That's how you're supposed to.
- I can't do that.

980
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,813
Eat it. Come on.
Take it, take it, take it.

981
00:52:37,815 --> 00:52:39,215
I gotta drive.
Ten and two on the wheel.

982
00:52:39,217 --> 00:52:40,883
- Come on. Take it, take it, take it.
- Tony...

983
00:52:40,885 --> 00:52:42,084
Come on, come on.

984
00:52:42,086 --> 00:52:44,086
There you go.

985
00:52:44,088 --> 00:52:45,955
Huh?

986
00:52:45,957 --> 00:52:47,823
I-I can't do this, Tony.

987
00:52:47,825 --> 00:52:49,992
Eat the goddamn thing!

988
00:52:49,994 --> 00:52:51,963
Jesus.

989
00:53:01,973 --> 00:53:04,373
- What, no good?
- Mm.

990
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:11,948
It just seems...

991
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:14,250
so un... unsanitary.

992
00:53:14,252 --> 00:53:16,118
Who gives a shit?

993
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:18,254
Just relax and enjoy it.

994
00:53:18,256 --> 00:53:21,290
You know,
my father used to say...

995
00:53:21,292 --> 00:53:24,026
"Whatever you do,
do it a hundred percent."

996

998
00:53:30,201 --> 00:53:32,001
You want another piece?

999
00:53:32,003 --> 00:53:33,836
Here. Have a breast.

1000
00:53:33,838 --> 00:53:35,073
Delicious.

1001
00:53:36,241 --> 00:53:38,040
Take it. Here you go.

1003

What, you too high and mighty?

1036
00:55:50,108 --> 00:55:52,408
No, no,
let him alone, let him alone.

1037
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:55,277
He just afraid of getting that

1050
00:57:06,083 --> 00:57:08,083
Get up.

1051
00:57:08,085 --> 00:57:10,288
Tony, come on. Hurry up.

1052
00:57:11,789 --> 00:57:14,089
Dr. Shirley's in trouble.

1053
00:57:14,091 --> 00:57:16,225
I went out for a drink,
I walk into this bar,

1054
00:57:16,227 --> 00:57:18,093
and Dr. Shirley's in there
getting bounced around.

1055
00:57:18,095 --> 00:57:20,496
I didn't want to leave him,
but I didn't know what to do.

1056
00:57:20,498 --> 00:57:22,131
Who let him out of his cage?

1057
00:57:22,133 --> 00:57:24,099
And they put that little tie
on him, too.

1058
00:57:24,101 --> 00:57:25,301
- Why you all dressed up?
- Yeah.

1059
00:57:27,338 --> 00:57:29,240
Get your hands off him.

1060
00:57:31,342 --> 00:57:34,510
What in the good goddamn
we got here, fellas?

1061
00:57:34,512 --> 00:57:36,045
Hand him over.

1062
00:57:36,047 --> 00:57:38,180
We walk out.
Won't be a problem.

1063
00:57:38,182 --> 00:57:40,316
I just wanted a drink, Tony.

1064
00:57:40,318 --> 00:57:42,384
Hey, I told you we'll leave.

1065
00:57:42,386 --> 00:57:45,254
- Not a big deal. Come on.
- He ain't going nowhere.

1066
00:57:45,256 --> 00:57:47,289
We need a Brillo Pad
to wash these dishes with.

1067
00:57:47,291 --> 00:57:49,158
Listen, assholes.

1068
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,527
Do yourselves a favor
and let him go.

1069
00:57:51,529 --> 00:57:52,997
Now!

1070
00:57:55,132 --> 00:57:57,068
Say it nice.

1071
00:57:58,135 --> 00:58:00,202
I just said it nice.

1072
00:58:00,204 --> 00:58:03,472
This boy is gonna get
what he's got coming to him.

1073
00:58:05,276 --> 00:58:09,213
And you, you ain't got no say.

1074
00:58:11,282 --> 00:58:12,648
Maybe.

1075
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:16,151
But whatever happens here,
I'm gonna put a bullet

1076
00:58:16,153 --> 00:58:18,287
right in the middle
of your thick skull.

1077
00:58:18,289 --> 00:58:21,390
He ain't got no gun, Ray.

1078
00:58:21,392 --> 00:58:23,559
He's full of shit.

1079
00:58:23,561 --> 00:58:26,130
What if he ain't?

1080
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:31,667
Well, I sure ain't.

1081
00:58:31,669 --> 00:58:35,506
And I ain't about to let this
come to pass in my place.

1082
00:58:38,342 --> 00:58:40,175
Let the spook go.

1083
00:58:40,177 --> 00:58:41,212
Let him go.

1084
00:58:42,313 --> 00:58:44,280
Come on.

1085
00:58:44,282 --> 00:58:46,315
Get him out of here.

1086
00:58:46,317 --> 00:58:50,119
I want these Yankees
off of my property.

1087
00:58:50,121 --> 00:58:52,521
- Go on.
- Go on, George. Go. Go.

1088
00:58:52,523 --> 00:58:54,525
I got you, Doc.

1089
00:58:56,561 --> 00:58:57,628
Go on.

1090
00:59:04,735 --> 00:59:07,136
- You out of your mind?
- I'm sorry.

1091
00:59:07,138 --> 00:59:10,139
I didn't mean to put you
in that position.

1092
00:59:10,141 --> 00:59:11,507
Wait, wait, wait.

1093
00:59:11,509 --> 00:59:14,512
Are you gonna throw up again?

1094
00:59:16,213 --> 00:59:17,646
I'm okay.

1095
00:59:17,648 --> 00:59:19,548
Honest to God, Doc,
I don't understand you.

1096
00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:22,217
You could have drunk here.
You got a whole bottle.

1097
00:59:22,219 --> 00:59:24,320
I just needed some air.

1098
00:59:24,322 --> 00:59:25,354
Air?

1099
00:59:25,356 --> 00:59:27,258
Do you know where you are?

1100
00:59:28,359 --> 00:59:30,492
Does geography really matter?

1101
00:59:30,494 --> 00:59:32,494
What?

1102
00:59:32,496 --> 00:59:36,165
If I was in a bar
in your neighborhood,

1103
00:59:36,167 --> 00:59:39,570
would the conversation
be any different?

1104
00:59:42,206 --> 00:59:44,640
From now on, you don't go
nowhere without me.

1105
00:59:44,642 --> 00:59:47,276
Nowhere!

1106
00:59:47,278 --> 00:59:49,680
- Got it?
- I-I understand.

1111
00:59:58,957 --> 01:00:01,390
Course not.

1112
01:00:01,392 --> 01:00:04,096
Doc, where's your goddamn room?

1113
01:00:07,966 --> 01:00:09,465
- Come on.
- There it is.

1114
01:00:09,467 --> 01:00:10,733
Over there?

1115
01:00:10,735 --> 01:00:12,334
You gotta get to bed, Doc.

1116
01:00:12,336 --> 01:00:15,204
You got a big show

01:01:12,697 --> 01:01:14,563
Athletes practice.
They don't rehearse.

1133
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:18,804
Ah, shit.

1134
01:02:42,888 --> 01:02:46,823
Ladies and gentlemen,
a very special guest

1135
01:02:46,825 --> 01:02:48,825
from the far north,

1136
01:02:48,827 --> 01:02:51,295
Don Shirley.

1137
01:02:54,765 --> 01:02:58,400
Accompanying Mr. Shirley,
the members of his trio,

1138
01:02:58,402 --> 01:03:02,939
Oleg Malacovich, George Dyer,
and his associate

1139
01:03:02,941 --> 01:03:06,943
Tony Valle... Valle...
Vallelong-longia.

1140
01:03:11,983 --> 01:03:14,650
Oh, this is my lovely wife,
Margaret.

1141
01:03:14,652 --> 01:03:15,819
If you gentlemen don't mind,

1142
01:03:15,821 --> 01:03:17,153
we're going to steal
Donnie away

1143
01:03:17,155 --> 01:03:18,890
for some, uh, introductions.

1144
01:03:21,392 --> 01:03:23,692
I'd like you all
to meet Don Shirley.

1145
01:03:23,694 --> 01:03:25,862
- Yeah. I'll take one.
- Hmm.

1146
01:03:25,864 --> 01:03:27,396
What's that?

1147
01:03:27,398 --> 01:03:28,898
A pimento and cheese
sandwich, sir.

1148
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:30,701
Yeah, I'll try one of them.

1149
01:03:33,470 --> 01:03:35,472
Oof.

1150
01:03:41,012 --> 01:03:42,646
Sorry. Not for me.

1151
01:03:51,455 --> 01:03:53,422
Earlier this week,
we asked our help

1152
01:03:53,424 --> 01:03:55,624
what Mr. Shirley
might like for supper.

1153
01:03:55,626 --> 01:03:58,660
So the boys in the kitchen
whipped up a special menu

1154
01:03:58,662 --> 01:03:59,829
- in honor of our guest.
- Oh!

1155
01:03:59,831 --> 01:04:01,898
Gentlemen.

1156
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:03,800
Home-cooked fried chicken.

1157
01:04:10,809 --> 01:04:12,474
There we go.

1158
01:04:12,476 --> 01:04:14,509
Bring it in. Serve it up hot.

1159
01:04:43,942 --> 01:04:47,411
Thank you. Thank you.

1160
01:04:48,679 --> 01:04:50,646
We'll return after
a brief intermission.

1161
01:04:53,484 --> 01:04:55,550
Excuse me, Don.

1162
01:04:55,552 --> 01:04:57,921
- Lovely work in there.
- Why, thank you.

1163
01:04:57,923 --> 01:04:59,755
Uh, are you looking
for the commode?

1164
01:04:59,757 --> 01:05:01,824
- Yes. I...
- Yeah, here. Let me help you.

1165
01:05:01,826 --> 01:05:03,761
It's right out there
before that pine.

1166
01:05:08,833 --> 01:05:10,833
I'd prefer not to use that.

1167
01:05:10,835 --> 01:05:12,068
Well, don't be silly, Don.

1168
01:05:12,070 --> 01:05:14,103
It looks a lot worse
from the outside.

1169
01:05:14,105 --> 01:05:16,672
And I suppose you'd know
from experience.

1170
01:05:16,674 --> 01:05:19,443
Well, I've never had
any complaints.

1171
01:05:23,014 --> 01:05:24,881
Well, I could return
to my motel

1172
01:05:24,883 --> 01:05:27,116
and use the facilities there,

1173
01:05:27,118 --> 01:05:30,454
but that would take
at least a half an hour.

1174
01:05:33,858 --> 01:05:35,860
We don't mind waiting.

1175
01:05:37,095 --> 01:05:38,995
<i>Why don't I just pull over?</i>

1176
01:05:38,997 --> 01:05:40,562
You can piss in the woods.

1177
01:05:40,564 --> 01:05:41,730
Animals go in the woods.

1178
01:05:41,732 --> 01:05:43,032
It's gonna be
at least 20 minutes,

1179
01:05:43,034 --> 01:05:45,134
I gotta go all the way back
to your motel.

1180
01:05:45,136 --> 01:05:46,635
So let's just get there

1181
01:05:46,637 --> 01:05:48,570
so I can go back
and finish the show.

1182
01:05:48,572 --> 01:05:51,007
See, that's the
difference between you and me.

1183
01:05:51,009 --> 01:05:52,708
I'd have zero problem
going in the woods.

1184
01:05:52,710 --> 01:05:53,943
I'm well aware.

1185
01:05:53,945 --> 01:05:55,878
What are you sore at me for?

1186
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:57,779
I don't make the rules
down here.

1187
01:05:57,781 --> 01:05:59,148
No?

1188
01:05:59,150 --> 01:06:01,017
Then who does?

1189
01:06:01,019 --> 01:06:02,852
Oh.

1190
01:06:02,854 --> 01:06:05,687
You're saying just 'cause
I'm white and they're white?

1191
01:06:05,689 --> 01:06:07,123
You know, that's a very
prejudiced thing

1192
01:06:07,125 --> 01:06:08,757
you just said there.

1193
01:06:08,759 --> 01:06:09,892
A very prejudiced thing.

1194
01:06:09,894 --> 01:06:11,995
I got more in common
with the Hymies

1195
01:06:11,997 --> 01:06:13,795
at 2nd Avenue Deli than I do

1196
01:06:13,797 --> 01:06:15,331
with these hillbilly pricks
down here.

1197
01:06:15,333 --> 01:06:16,732
Eyes on the road.

1198
01:06:16,734 --> 01:06:17,566
You always say that

1199
01:06:17,568 --> 01:06:19,102
when you don't like
what I'm saying.

1200
01:06:19,104 --> 01:06:20,905
Eyes on the road.

1201
01:06:24,742 --> 01:06:26,675
I don't get it.

1202
01:06:26,677 --> 01:06:29,778
How does he smile and shake
their hands like that?

1203
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:32,015
They try to pull
that outhouse shit on me,

1204
01:06:32,017 --> 01:06:34,052
I'd piss right
on the living room floor.

1205
01:06:35,854 --> 01:06:37,788
Don't-don't do that.

1206
01:06:39,157 --> 01:06:41,960
We have many
concert dates left.

1207
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:46,628
Yeah? So?

1208
01:06:46,630 --> 01:06:49,533
You realize we're contractually
obliged to perform them?

1209
01:06:50,701 --> 01:06:52,035
Course I do.

1210
01:06:52,037 --> 01:06:54,669
You don't play,
we don't get paid.

1211
01:06:54,671 --> 01:06:56,072
What's your point?

1212
01:06:56,074 --> 01:06:59,175
Ugly circumstances
are going to happen again,

1213
01:06:59,177 --> 01:07:01,643
so control yourself.

1214
01:07:01,645 --> 01:07:04,049
Don't lecture me, you rat.

1215
01:07:05,950 --> 01:07:08,217
Dr. Shirley could have
stayed up north,

1216
01:07:08,219 --> 01:07:10,920
getting rear end kissed
at Park Avenue parties

1217
01:07:10,922 --> 01:07:12,822
for three times money.

1218
01:07:12,824 --> 01:07:15,124
But he ask for this.

1219
01:07:19,696 --> 01:07:20,899
Why?

1220
01:07:40,717 --> 01:07:42,985
What on God's green Earth
are you doing?

1221
01:07:42,987 --> 01:07:44,887
A letter.

1222
01:07:44,889 --> 01:07:48,124
Looks more like
a piecemeal ransom note.

1223
01:07:48,126 --> 01:07:49,994
May I?

1224
01:07:56,868 --> 01:07:59,001
"Dear Dolores."

1225
01:07:59,003 --> 01:08:00,436
D-E-A-R.

1226
01:08:00,438 --> 01:08:02,038
This is an animal.

1227
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:04,739
"I'm meeting all
the highly leading citizens

1228
01:08:04,741 --> 01:08:07,009
"of the town.

1229
01:08:07,011 --> 01:08:10,745
"People that use big words,
all of them.

1230
01:08:10,747 --> 01:08:13,282
"But you know me. I get by.

1231
01:08:13,284 --> 01:08:15,151
I'm a good bullshitter."

1232
01:08:15,153 --> 01:08:17,920
Two T's in "bullshitter."

1233
01:08:17,922 --> 01:08:22,058
"As I'm writing this letter,
I'm eating potato chips,

1234
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:25,794
"and I'm starting
to get thirsty.

1235
01:08:25,796 --> 01:08:29,298
"I washed my socks
and dried them on the TV.

1236
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:32,068
I should have brung the iron."

1237
01:08:32,070 --> 01:08:33,905
You know this is pathetic,
right?

1238
01:08:35,039 --> 01:08:37,039
Tell me what you're trying
to say.

1239
01:08:37,041 --> 01:08:39,308
I don't know.

1240
01:08:39,310 --> 01:08:41,743
You know, I miss her and shit.

1241
01:08:41,745 --> 01:08:42,912
Then say that.

1242
01:08:42,914 --> 01:08:44,947
But do it in a manner
that no one else

1243
01:08:44,949 --> 01:08:46,748
has ever done it before.

1244
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:48,186
And without the profanity.

1245
01:08:49,187 --> 01:08:51,720
Something like, uh...

1246
01:08:51,722 --> 01:08:53,825
Put this down.

1247
01:08:55,792 --> 01:08:57,326
"Dear Dolores."

1248
01:08:57,328 --> 01:08:59,761
Hold on. I'll start a new one.

1249
01:08:59,763 --> 01:09:02,934
"D-E-A-R Dolores."

1250
01:09:05,003 --> 01:09:08,070
"When I think of you,

1251
01:09:08,072 --> 01:09:12,774
I'm reminded of
the beautiful plains of Iowa."

1252
01:09:12,776 --> 01:09:14,277
What planes?

1253
01:09:14,279 --> 01:09:16,078
The plains.

1254
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,813
P-L-A-I-N-S.

1255
01:09:17,815 --> 01:09:19,081
Those big fields we saw.

1256
01:09:19,083 --> 01:09:21,317
Oh. Yeah, those were nice.

1257
01:09:21,319 --> 01:09:23,352
Plains.

1258
01:09:23,354 --> 01:09:27,089
"Which is what they call...

1259
01:09:27,091 --> 01:09:30,759
big fields around here."

1260
01:09:30,761 --> 01:09:32,761
Tony, no expounding.

1261
01:09:32,763 --> 01:09:35,097
- No what?
- Just write what I say.

1262
01:09:35,099 --> 01:09:36,966
No good.

1263
01:09:36,968 --> 01:09:40,236
"The distance between us...

1264
01:09:40,238 --> 01:09:42,874
is breaking my spirit."

1265
01:09:44,108 --> 01:09:46,275
"Between us..."

1266
01:09:46,277 --> 01:09:48,911
"My time and experiences
without you

1267
01:09:48,913 --> 01:09:50,949
"are meaningless to me.

1268
01:09:54,252 --> 01:09:56,052
"Falling in love with you

1269
01:09:56,054 --> 01:09:58,988
was the easiest thing
I've ever done."

1270
01:09:58,990 --> 01:10:03,292
"Falling in love with you..."

1271
01:10:03,294 --> 01:10:06,795
This is very fucking romantic.

1272
01:10:06,797 --> 01:10:08,264
<i>...was the easiest thing</i>

1273
01:10:08,266 --> 01:10:10,099
<i>I have ever done.</i>

1274
01:10:10,101 --> 01:10:13,102
<i>Nothing matters to me but you,</i>

1275
01:10:13,104 --> 01:10:16,305
<i>and every day I'm alive,
I'm aware of this.</i>

1276
01:10:16,307 --> 01:10:20,576
<i>I loved you the day I met you,
I love you today,</i>

1277
01:10:20,578 --> 01:10:24,082
<i>and I will love you
the rest of my life.</i>

1278
01:10:26,417 --> 01:10:29,051
So, can I put, uh...
"P.S. Kiss the kids"?

1279
01:10:29,053 --> 01:10:30,386
A P.S.?

1280
01:10:30,388 --> 01:10:32,123
Yeah, like, at the end.

1281
01:10:33,157 --> 01:10:34,991
That's like clanging a cowbell

1282
01:10:34,993 --> 01:10:37,128
at the end
of Shostakovich's Seventh.

1283
01:10:38,896 --> 01:10:40,898
Right. And that's good?

1284
01:10:42,033 --> 01:10:44,002
It's perfect, Tony.

1285
01:10:47,605 --> 01:10:50,606
Everybody talks
about Willie Mays, 1954.

1286
01:10:50,608 --> 01:10:52,908
It wasn't even the greatest
catch in the Polo Grounds.

1287
01:10:52,910 --> 01:10:55,878
That was Joe DiMaggio, 1936,

1288
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:57,213
second game
of the World Series.

1289
01:10:57,215 --> 01:11:00,184
Final out, 500 feet...

1290
01:11:03,221 --> 01:11:05,121
You like that, Doc?

1291
01:11:05,123 --> 01:11:06,322
That's a handsome suit.

1292
01:11:06,324 --> 01:11:08,924
- Sharp.
- Mm-hmm.

1293
01:11:08,926 --> 01:11:11,227
Guy looks just like you.

1294
01:11:11,229 --> 01:11:13,164
He does?

1295
01:11:14,332 --> 01:11:16,834
Well, size-wise. Yeah.

1296
01:11:19,070 --> 01:11:21,170
It is about a 42.

1297
01:11:21,172 --> 01:11:24,240
- Why don't you try it on?
- Hmm...

1298
01:11:24,242 --> 01:11:27,276
What, you gotta wear
a tuxedo onstage every night?

1299
01:11:27,278 --> 01:11:29,245
You could mix it up
a little, Doc.

1300
01:11:29,247 --> 01:11:31,113
Come on, let's see
how it looks on you.

1301
01:11:31,115 --> 01:11:32,248
We got plenty of time.

1302
01:11:35,053 --> 01:11:36,652
I'll be right back.

1303
01:11:36,654 --> 01:11:39,488
- How you doing?
- May I help you, sir?

1304
01:11:39,490 --> 01:11:41,357
Yeah, we want
to try on that, uh,

1305
01:11:41,359 --> 01:11:43,059
beautiful gray suit
in the window.

1306
01:11:43,061 --> 01:11:44,327
You got it in a 42?

1307
01:11:44,329 --> 01:11:46,230
Of course.

1308
01:11:48,399 --> 01:11:50,099
That's the one.

1309
01:11:50,101 --> 01:11:51,967
Dressing room
is in the back, sir.

1310
01:11:51,969 --> 01:11:53,336
Thank you.

1311
01:11:53,338 --> 01:11:55,671
- I'll be just a moment.
- Take your time, Doc.

1312
01:11:55,673 --> 01:11:57,408
I'll check out
some ties for you.

1313
01:11:58,976 --> 01:12:00,976
Uh, e-excuse me.

1314
01:12:00,978 --> 01:12:03,348
Uh, you're not allowed
to try that on.

1315
01:12:04,982 --> 01:12:06,315
I beg your pardon?

1316
01:12:06,317 --> 01:12:08,684
Uh, if you'd like
to purchase it first,

1317
01:12:08,686 --> 01:12:11,389
we'd be happy
to tailor it to your needs.

1318
01:12:13,491 --> 01:12:16,227
I see.

1319
01:13:17,321 --> 01:13:19,023
Yeah.

1320
01:13:20,158 --> 01:13:21,993
That's me.

1321
01:13:32,570 --> 01:13:34,336
Hey, Officer.

1322
01:13:34,338 --> 01:13:36,439
I got a call about Dr. Shirley.

1323
01:13:36,441 --> 01:13:38,476
Come on.

1324
01:13:43,147 --> 01:13:45,481
His friend's here.

1325
01:13:45,483 --> 01:13:47,483
Thank you.

1326
01:13:52,089 --> 01:13:54,523
Get a guy a towel,
for Christ's sake.

1327
01:13:54,525 --> 01:13:56,225
You a lawyer?

1328
01:13:56,227 --> 01:13:57,493
- No.
- Well, you should call one.

1329
01:13:57,495 --> 01:13:59,428
- We're taking your auntie in.
- For what?

1330
01:13:59,430 --> 01:14:02,233
Manager caught him
and the other guy.

1331
01:14:05,603 --> 01:14:08,204
Well, can we get
the cuffs off him,

1332
01:14:08,206 --> 01:14:10,439
let him put his pants on,
we talk about this?

1333
01:14:10,441 --> 01:14:12,107
Sure, we could.

1334
01:14:12,109 --> 01:14:14,076
But we ain't.

1335
01:14:14,078 --> 01:14:17,112
Okay, look, we're out of here
tomorrow morning.

1336
01:14:17,114 --> 01:14:18,547
You'll never see us again.

1337
01:14:18,549 --> 01:14:21,118
There's gotta be something
we can do to work this out.

1338
01:14:23,087 --> 01:14:24,253
What if you let him go

1339
01:14:24,255 --> 01:14:26,388
and I give you something
to thank you?

1340
01:14:27,625 --> 01:14:29,625
- You bribing us?
- No.

1341
01:14:29,627 --> 01:14:31,060
Hell no.

1342
01:14:31,062 --> 01:14:32,228
A gift.

1343
01:14:32,230 --> 01:14:33,529
A thank-you.

1344
01:14:33,531 --> 01:14:36,065
What kind of thank-you?

1345
01:14:36,067 --> 01:14:37,600
Like a...

1346
01:14:37,602 --> 01:14:39,568
you know, donation
to the police force.

1347
01:14:39,570 --> 01:14:41,270
Youse guys.

1348
01:14:41,272 --> 01:14:43,339
Whatever you want.

1349
01:14:43,341 --> 01:14:46,108
You like suits?

1350
01:14:46,110 --> 01:14:48,210
I was walking through
your nice town today,

1351
01:14:48,212 --> 01:14:51,247
and I seen a store
that was selling suits.

1352
01:14:51,249 --> 01:14:53,115
Primo suits.

1353
01:14:53,117 --> 01:14:56,585
What if, as a thank-you...
a donation...

1354
01:14:56,587 --> 01:14:59,555
I buy youse each a suit?

1355
01:14:59,557 --> 01:15:01,357
You get all dressed up,

1356
01:15:01,359 --> 01:15:03,559
you take the wife out
for dinner.

1357
01:15:03,561 --> 01:15:05,561
I mean, guys like you,
you work hard.

1358
01:15:05,563 --> 01:15:07,565
You deserve it.

1359
01:15:14,238 --> 01:15:16,238
They were wrong
for the way they treated me,

1360
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:18,309
and you rewarded them.

1361
01:15:20,111 --> 01:15:22,444
I was hired to get you
from one show to the next.

1362
01:15:22,446 --> 01:15:24,280
How I do it
shouldn't matter to you.

1363
01:15:24,282 --> 01:15:26,148
I just wish you hadn't
paid 'em off.

1364
01:15:26,150 --> 01:15:28,484
I did what I had to do.

1365
01:15:28,486 --> 01:15:30,887
You know, if this got out,
it would kill your career.

1366
01:15:30,889 --> 01:15:33,188
Okay, Tony.

1367
01:15:33,190 --> 01:15:35,224
I need you to stop it
with the phony altruism

1368
01:15:35,226 --> 01:15:36,659
and concern for my career.

1369
01:15:36,661 --> 01:15:38,394
What the hell does that mean?

1370
01:15:38,396 --> 01:15:40,195
You were only thinking
about yourself back there

1371
01:15:40,197 --> 01:15:41,597
because you know,
if I miss a show,

1372
01:15:41,599 --> 01:15:43,198
it'll come out
of your pocketbook.

1373
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:45,234
Of course I don't want you
to miss a show,

1374
01:15:45,236 --> 01:15:46,435
you ungrateful bastard.

1375
01:15:46,437 --> 01:15:48,537
You think I'm doing this
for my health?

1376
01:15:48,539 --> 01:15:50,606
Tonight, I saved your ass.

1377
01:15:50,608 --> 01:15:53,309
So show a little
appreciation, maybe.

1378
01:15:53,311 --> 01:15:57,613
Besides, I told you never
to go nowhere without me!

1379
01:15:57,615 --> 01:16:01,650
I assumed you'd want this
to be the exception.

1380
01:16:36,220 --> 01:16:38,520
Want me to get some makeup
or something

1381
01:16:38,522 --> 01:16:39,755
for the show tomorrow?

1382
01:16:39,757 --> 01:16:41,357
No, I'm fine.

1383
01:16:41,359 --> 01:16:43,525
You sure? Bruise kind of shows.

1384
01:16:43,527 --> 01:16:44,729
I said I'm fine.

1385
01:16:46,263 --> 01:16:48,232
Okay.

1386
01:16:54,672 --> 01:16:56,505
He didn't ask me to do that.

1387
01:16:56,507 --> 01:16:58,674
Dom, I'm telling you,
that's what he told me.

1388
01:16:58,676 --> 01:17:00,275
He didn't ask me.

1389
01:17:00,277 --> 01:17:02,778
Oh. Tony Lip.

1390
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:04,380
- Dominic, Mags.
- What the hell...?

1391
01:17:04,382 --> 01:17:05,748
What the hell you guys
doing down here?

1392
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:07,282
Hey, Brooklyn sent us down.

1393
01:17:07,284 --> 01:17:09,487
- Take care of a few things.
- Yeah.

1394
01:17:44,321 --> 01:17:46,158
I'm working here.

1395
01:17:55,033 --> 01:17:57,599
Sorry, Doc. They're some
friends from New York.

1396
01:17:57,601 --> 01:17:59,601
Hey, can you get
Dr. Shirley's luggage?

1397
01:17:59,603 --> 01:18:00,705
All right.

1398
01:18:33,537 --> 01:18:34,871
Called his room.

1399
01:18:34,873 --> 01:18:36,707
Be down in a minute.

1400
01:18:45,449 --> 01:18:46,816
Hey, Doc.

1401
01:18:46,818 --> 01:18:48,686
Where are you off to?

1402
01:18:50,321 --> 01:18:52,354
Just going downstairs.

1403
01:18:52,356 --> 01:18:54,291
To have a drink.

1404
01:19:04,602 --> 01:19:06,401
Tony...

1405
01:19:06,403 --> 01:19:10,106
I think you're doing
a wonderful job.

1406
01:19:10,108 --> 01:19:12,374
So...

1407
01:19:12,376 --> 01:19:13,877
I'd like to formally offer you

1408
01:19:13,879 --> 01:19:15,677
the position
of my road manager.

1409
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:20,582
With the title also comes
more responsibility, but...

1410
01:19:20,584 --> 01:19:22,586
that also means a raise in pay.

1411
01:19:23,654 --> 01:19:25,754
No. No.

1412
01:19:25,756 --> 01:19:28,724
No, thanks.

1413
01:19:28,726 --> 01:19:32,896
We agreed on 125 a week,
plus expenses.

1414
01:19:32,898 --> 01:19:35,834
That's our deal, right?

1415
01:19:37,501 --> 01:19:39,434
I ain't going nowhere, Doc.

1416
01:19:39,436 --> 01:19:41,739
I-I was just going down
to tell them.

1417
01:19:52,416 --> 01:19:53,584
Tony.

1418
01:19:58,455 --> 01:20:00,826
I'm sorry about last night.

1419
01:20:03,962 --> 01:20:06,397
Don't worry about it.

1420
01:20:07,933 --> 01:20:11,400
I've been working nightclubs
in New York City my whole life.

1421
01:20:11,402 --> 01:20:15,472
I know it's a...
complicated world.

1422
01:20:27,718 --> 01:20:29,451
<i>So, where'd you learn</i>

1423
01:20:29,453 --> 01:20:30,686
how to play like that?

1424
01:20:30,688 --> 01:20:32,621
- My mother.
- Your mother?

1425
01:20:32,623 --> 01:20:34,592
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1426
01:20:36,460 --> 01:20:39,896
She taught me how to play
on an old spinet.

1427
01:20:39,898 --> 01:20:42,464
Soon as I could walk, we'd...

1428
01:20:42,466 --> 01:20:44,700
travel around
the Florida Panhandle,

1429
01:20:44,702 --> 01:20:48,437
put on my little shows
in parishes and halls.

1430
01:20:48,439 --> 01:20:50,639
Fortunately,
a man who had seen me play

1431
01:20:50,641 --> 01:20:51,908
arranged for me to study

1432
01:20:51,910 --> 01:20:53,943
at the Leningrad Conservatory
of Music.

1433
01:20:53,945 --> 01:20:56,778
I was the first Negro
ever accepted there.

1434
01:20:56,780 --> 01:20:59,215
That's where they taught you
all them songs you play?

1435
01:20:59,217 --> 01:21:02,451
Actually, I was trained
to play classical music.

1436
01:21:02,453 --> 01:21:06,724
Brahms, Franz Liszt,
Beethoven, Chopin.

1437
01:21:07,791 --> 01:21:10,059
It's all I ever wanted to play.

1438
01:21:10,061 --> 01:21:12,996
But I was persuaded
by my record company

1439
01:21:12,998 --> 01:21:16,866
to pursue a career
in popular music instead.

1440
01:21:16,868 --> 01:21:19,468
They insisted that audiences
would never accept

1441
01:21:19,470 --> 01:21:21,637
a Negro pianist
on a classical stage.

1442
01:21:21,639 --> 01:21:26,541
Wanted to turn me into just
another colored entertainer.

1443
01:21:26,543 --> 01:21:29,946
You know, the guy who's smoking
while he's playing

1444
01:21:29,948 --> 01:21:32,815
and sets a glass of whiskey
on his piano,

1445
01:21:32,817 --> 01:21:35,550
and then complains
because he's not respected

1446
01:21:35,552 --> 01:21:36,953
like Arthur Rubinstein.

1447
01:21:36,955 --> 01:21:39,856
You don't see Arthur Rubinstein

1448
01:21:39,858 --> 01:21:42,493
putting a glass of whiskey
on his piano.

1449
01:21:43,828 --> 01:21:45,862
I don't know.
Personally, I think,

1450
01:21:45,864 --> 01:21:47,663
if you stuck
to the classic stuff,

1451
01:21:47,665 --> 01:21:49,265
it would've been a big mistake.

1452
01:21:49,267 --> 01:21:50,867
A mistake?

1453
01:21:50,869 --> 01:21:54,103
Performing the music I trained
my entire life to play?

1454
01:21:54,105 --> 01:21:56,705
Trained?
What are you, a seal?

1455
01:21:56,707 --> 01:21:58,573
People love what you do.

1456
01:21:58,575 --> 01:22:01,010
Anyone could sound
like Beethoven or...

1457
01:22:01,012 --> 01:22:03,578
"Joe Pan"
or them other guys you said,

1458
01:22:03,580 --> 01:22:07,518
but your music, what you do...

1459
01:22:08,954 --> 01:22:10,754
...only you can do that.

1460
01:22:13,624 --> 01:22:14,993
Thank you, Tony.

1461
01:22:19,998 --> 01:22:22,633
But not everyone
can play Chopin.

1462
01:22:23,734 --> 01:22:25,736
Not like I can.

1496

We had to turn
off the main road,

1497
01:25:15,073 --> 01:25:18,042
and, uh, now we're lost.

Step out of the car.

What'd I do?

1500

Out of the car.

1501
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:38,127
Why are you on this road?

1502
01:25:38,129 --> 01:25:39,495
I told you.

1503
01:25:39,497 --> 01:25:43,067
We had to make a detour,
and we got lost.

1504
01:25:47,505 --> 01:25:49,338
And why are you driving him?

1505
01:25:49,340 --> 01:25:51,943
He's my boss.

1506
01:25:57,748 --> 01:25:59,815
He can't be out here at night.

1507
01:25:59,817 --> 01:26:01,750
This is a sundown town.

1508
01:26:01,752 --> 01:26:03,054
What's that?

1509
01:26:04,355 --> 01:26:07,156
Get him out of the car
and check his I.D.

1510
01:26:07,158 --> 01:26:08,324
Oh, come on.

1511
01:26:08,326 --> 01:26:09,458
It's pouring rain.

1512
01:26:09,460 --> 01:26:12,794
Sir, I can just get it
right here through the window.

1513
01:26:12,796 --> 01:26:13,996
Get him out of the car.

1514
01:26:13,998 --> 01:26:15,865
Come on, get out, now.

1515
01:26:15,867 --> 01:26:17,766
Get out, now. Get out.

1516
01:26:17,768 --> 01:26:20,171
Got I.D.?

1517
01:26:22,207 --> 01:26:25,174
How you say this last name?

1518
01:26:25,176 --> 01:26:27,310
Vallelonga.

1519
01:26:27,312 --> 01:26:29,778
Yeah, what kind of name
is that?

1520
01:26:29,780 --> 01:26:31,147
It's Italian.

1521
01:26:31,149 --> 01:26:32,281
Oh.

1522
01:26:32,283 --> 01:26:33,883
Oh, I see.

1523
01:26:33,885 --> 01:26:36,187
That's why
you're driving him around.

1524
01:26:38,223 --> 01:26:39,989
You're half a nigger yourself.

1525
01:26:40,992 --> 01:26:42,825
Hands in the air!

1526
01:26:42,827 --> 01:26:44,128
Now! Now!

1527
01:26:47,865 --> 01:26:49,766
Excuse me.

1528
01:26:53,037 --> 01:26:56,806
Excuse me, sirs.

1529
01:26:56,808 --> 01:27:00,009
I-I understand why my associate
is being held,

1530
01:27:00,011 --> 01:27:02,981
but what exactly am I
being charged with?

1531
01:27:05,883 --> 01:27:09,085
You seem like reasonable men.

1532
01:27:09,087 --> 01:27:10,386
Perhaps you could let me out

1533
01:27:10,388 --> 01:27:12,888
so that we could discuss
the situation further.

1534
01:27:12,890 --> 01:27:14,824
Just put the apple butter
away, boy.

1535
01:27:14,826 --> 01:27:17,827
You ain't going nowhere
no time soon.

1536
01:27:17,829 --> 01:27:20,930
You cannot hold me
without cause.

1537
01:27:20,932 --> 01:27:22,265
Well, I got cause.

1538
01:27:22,267 --> 01:27:25,036
'Cause you let the sun set
on your black ass.

1539
01:27:26,371 --> 01:27:28,971
I want to speak to my lawyer.

1540
01:27:28,973 --> 01:27:31,140
I want my call.

1541
01:27:31,142 --> 01:27:34,410
This is a flagrant violation
of my rights.

1542
01:27:34,412 --> 01:27:37,847
You know...

1543
01:27:37,849 --> 01:27:41,986
he does have, uh, rights.

1544
01:27:46,424 --> 01:27:49,859
Give the Negro
his goddamn phone call.

1545
01:27:49,861 --> 01:27:51,329
You happy?

1546
01:27:55,867 --> 01:27:57,633
You know a lawyer?

1547
01:27:57,635 --> 01:27:59,037
Call him.

1548
01:28:10,448 --> 01:28:12,181
I walk up
to the car, and I say,

1549
01:28:12,183 --> 01:28:14,050
"Sir, you know
how fast you were going?"

1550
01:28:14,052 --> 01:28:16,319
He says, "I'm sorry, Officer.
I didn't mean to speed, but..."

1551
01:28:16,321 --> 01:28:17,953
As my mother always said,

1552
01:28:17,955 --> 01:28:20,423
"What kind
of brand-new fool are you?"

1553
01:28:20,425 --> 01:28:22,391
Look at them over there.

1554
01:28:22,393 --> 01:28:25,027
Take a good look
at the officer you hit.

1555
01:28:25,029 --> 01:28:27,396
Look at him. He's over there
having a grand old time,

1556
01:28:27,398 --> 01:28:31,667
chatting up with his pals,
enjoying a nice cup of coffee.

1557
01:28:31,669 --> 01:28:33,903
And where are you?

1558
01:28:33,905 --> 01:28:36,906
In here, with me,
who did nothing.

1559
01:28:36,908 --> 01:28:39,208
Yet I'm the one
who pays the price.

1560
01:28:39,210 --> 01:28:42,111
I'm the one who's gonna miss
the Birmingham show.

1561
01:28:42,113 --> 01:28:44,013
Hey, I'm gonna lose
a lot of money, too,

1562
01:28:44,015 --> 01:28:45,414
if you don't play Birmingham.

1563
01:28:45,416 --> 01:28:48,886
So that little temper tantrum,
was it worth it?

1564
01:28:49,987 --> 01:28:51,987
Hmm?

1565
01:28:51,989 --> 01:28:53,989
You never win
with violence, Tony.

1566
01:28:53,991 --> 01:28:56,158
You only win when you maintain
your dignity.

1567
01:28:56,160 --> 01:29:00,262
Dignity always prevails.

1568
01:29:00,264 --> 01:29:03,468
And tonight,
because of you, we did not.

1569
01:29:08,339 --> 01:29:10,973
I wouldn't touch
that mattress, Doc.

1570
01:29:10,975 --> 01:29:13,311
Maryville Police.

1571
01:29:16,047 --> 01:29:17,947
No, sir.

1572
01:29:17,949 --> 01:29:20,383
No, no, I-I'm not, sir.

1573
01:29:20,385 --> 01:29:23,185
Yes, sir.
He's right here, sir. Yes, sir.

1574
01:29:23,187 --> 01:29:24,286
Yes, sir.

1575
01:29:24,288 --> 01:29:26,455
Give me.

1576
01:29:26,457 --> 01:29:28,424
Chief Pratt. Who's this?

1577
01:29:28,426 --> 01:29:30,361
Baloney.

1578
01:29:32,563 --> 01:29:34,163
Yes, sir.

1579
01:29:34,165 --> 01:29:37,433
I can hear it now, Governor.

1580
01:29:37,435 --> 01:29:40,169
Uh...

1581
01:29:40,171 --> 01:29:42,071
No, sir, I'm sorry. I...

1582
01:29:42,073 --> 01:29:44,442
No, of course I can recognize
your voice. It's...

1583
01:29:47,478 --> 01:29:49,478
Sir?

1584
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:53,317
You're saying the boy
we got locked up called who?

1585
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:58,320
Oh, and he called you.

1586
01:29:58,322 --> 01:30:00,256
No, no, sir.

1587
01:30:00,258 --> 01:30:03,428
An officer was assaulted
in the line of duty.

1588
01:30:06,197 --> 01:30:09,098
No, sir. No.
I don't want no National Guard

1589
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:11,066
coming down here, neither, sir.

1590
01:30:11,068 --> 01:30:13,471
I'll get to it immediately,
Governor.

1591
01:30:14,772 --> 01:30:17,208
Good night to you
and the missus.

1592
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:23,078
- Get 'em out.
- What?

1593
01:30:23,080 --> 01:30:24,413
Cut 'em goddamn loose.

1594
01:30:24,415 --> 01:30:26,482
That dago wop hit me!

1595
01:30:26,484 --> 01:30:28,217
You want to keep
your goddamn job?

1596
01:30:28,219 --> 01:30:30,252
Then you do what I goddamn
tell you to do

1597
01:30:30,254 --> 01:30:32,354
when I goddamn tell you
to do it!

1598
01:30:32,356 --> 01:30:35,357
And I'm telling you
to get 'em the goddamn out!

1599
01:30:35,359 --> 01:30:37,128
Who the hell did you call?

1600
01:30:39,130 --> 01:30:42,465
Bobby Kennedy
just saved our asses.

1601
01:30:42,467 --> 01:30:45,601
Madonne. <i>How great is that?</i>

1602
01:30:45,603 --> 01:30:47,236
It's not great.

1603
01:30:47,238 --> 01:30:48,805
It's not great at all.

1604
01:30:48,807 --> 01:30:51,173
- It's humiliating.
- The hell you talking about?

1605
01:30:51,175 --> 01:30:53,609
We were screwed. Now we ain't.

1606
01:30:53,611 --> 01:30:56,345
And I just put the attorney
general of the United States

1607
01:30:56,347 --> 01:30:57,546
in an incredibly awkward
position.

1608
01:30:57,548 --> 01:30:59,114
So what?

1609
01:30:59,116 --> 01:31:00,483
That's what the guy
gets paid for.

1610
01:31:00,485 --> 01:31:02,117
What else he got to do?

1611
01:31:02,119 --> 01:31:04,520
That man and his brother

1612
01:31:04,522 --> 01:31:06,121
are trying to change
this country.

1613
01:31:06,123 --> 01:31:08,557
That's what else he got to do.

1614
01:31:08,559 --> 01:31:12,194
Now he thinks
I'm some kind of...

1615
01:31:12,196 --> 01:31:15,598
Calling from some
backwoods swamp jail,

1616
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:19,068
asking to attenuate
assault charges? Who does that?

1617
01:31:19,070 --> 01:31:21,303
Garbage. That's who.

1618
01:31:21,305 --> 01:31:22,671
You shouldn't have hit him.

1619
01:31:22,673 --> 01:31:24,473
I didn't like the way
he was treating you.

1620
01:31:24,475 --> 01:31:26,275
Making you stand out
in the rain like that.

1621
01:31:26,277 --> 01:31:29,378
Please, you hit him
because of what he called you.

1622
01:31:29,380 --> 01:31:31,514
I've had to endure that kind
of talk my entire life.

1623
01:31:31,516 --> 01:31:33,649
You should be able to take it
for at least one night.

1624
01:31:33,651 --> 01:31:35,651
What? I can't get mad
at that stuff he was saying

1625
01:31:35,653 --> 01:31:37,186
'cause I ain't black?

1626
01:31:37,188 --> 01:31:38,420
Christ, I'm blacker
than you are.

1627
01:31:38,422 --> 01:31:40,122
- Excuse me?
- You don't know shit

1628
01:31:40,124 --> 01:31:41,624
about your own people.

1629
01:31:41,626 --> 01:31:45,127
What they eat, how they talk,
how they live.

1630
01:31:45,129 --> 01:31:46,695
You don't even know who
Little Richard is.

1631
01:31:46,697 --> 01:31:48,163
Oh, so knowing
who Little Richard is

1632
01:31:48,165 --> 01:31:49,231
makes you blacker than me?

1633
01:31:49,233 --> 01:31:52,334
Oh, Tony, I wish you could
hear yourself sometimes.

1634
01:31:52,336 --> 01:31:54,303
You wouldn't talk so damn much.

1635
01:31:54,305 --> 01:31:55,371
Bullshit.

1636
01:31:55,373 --> 01:31:57,673
I know exactly who I am.

1637
01:31:57,675 --> 01:31:59,608
I'm the guy who lived
in the same neighborhood

1638
01:31:59,610 --> 01:32:02,177
in the Bronx my entire life
with my mother, my father,

1639
01:32:02,179 --> 01:32:03,880
my brother,
and now my wife and kids.

1640
01:32:03,882 --> 01:32:05,882
That's it. That's who I am.

1641
01:32:05,884 --> 01:32:08,350
I'm the asshole who has
to hustle every goddamn day

1642
01:32:08,352 --> 01:32:10,119
to put food on the table.

1643
01:32:10,121 --> 01:32:13,155
You, Mr. Big Shot,
you live on top of a castle,

1644
01:32:13,157 --> 01:32:15,691
traveling around the world
doing concerts for rich people.

1645
01:32:15,693 --> 01:32:18,394
I live on the streets.
You sit on a throne.

1646
01:32:18,396 --> 01:32:21,265
So yeah, my world is way more
blacker than yours.

1647
01:32:22,433 --> 01:32:24,300
Pull over.

1648
01:32:24,302 --> 01:32:25,467
What?

1649
01:32:25,469 --> 01:32:27,469
- Pull over.
- I ain't pulling over.

1650
01:32:27,471 --> 01:32:29,340
Stop the car, Tony!

1651
01:32:31,742 --> 01:32:33,242
What?

1652
01:32:33,244 --> 01:32:35,411
What are you doing?

1653
01:32:35,413 --> 01:32:37,248
Doc.

1654
01:32:39,216 --> 01:32:41,317
Doc, what the hell
are you doing?

1655
01:32:41,319 --> 01:32:42,351
Doc.

1656
01:32:42,353 --> 01:32:44,253
Get back in the car.

1657
01:32:44,255 --> 01:32:47,091
Yes, I live in a castle, Tony!
Alone.

1658
01:32:49,260 --> 01:32:51,460
And rich white people pay me
to play piano for them

1659
01:32:51,462 --> 01:32:53,262
because it makes them
feel cultured.

1660
01:32:53,264 --> 01:32:55,731
But as soon as I step off
that stage, I go right back

1661
01:32:55,733 --> 01:32:58,200
to being just another nigger
to them.

1662
01:32:58,202 --> 01:33:00,235
Because that is
their true culture.

1663
01:33:00,237 --> 01:33:02,271
And I suffer that slight alone,

1664
01:33:02,273 --> 01:33:03,772
because I'm not accepted
by my own people

1665
01:33:03,774 --> 01:33:06,308
'cause I'm not like them,
either.

1666
01:33:06,310 --> 01:33:09,511
So, if I'm not black enough
and if I'm not white enough

1667
01:33:09,513 --> 01:33:13,351
and if I'm not man enough,
then tell me, Tony, what am I?

1668
01:33:47,284 --> 01:33:49,286
I need some sleep.

1669
01:33:52,423 --> 01:33:54,423
All right.

1670
01:33:54,425 --> 01:33:56,425
I'll stop at the next place
we see

1671
01:33:56,427 --> 01:33:57,693
and sneak you into my room.

1672
01:33:57,695 --> 01:33:59,461
No. No.

1673
01:33:59,463 --> 01:34:01,563
I refuse to stay
in an establishment

1674
01:34:01,565 --> 01:34:03,434
where I'm not welcome.

1675
01:34:05,503 --> 01:34:07,438
Yeah. Okay.

1676
01:34:25,456 --> 01:34:27,692
Tony, do you have
to smoke everywhere?

1677
01:34:30,028 --> 01:34:32,394
I didn't know it bothered you.

1678
01:34:32,396 --> 01:34:35,364
You should have told me.

1679
01:34:35,366 --> 01:34:37,635
All you gotta do
is say the word, Doc.

1680
01:34:50,048 --> 01:34:53,482
You do realize you'll be home
before that letter arrives.

1681
01:34:53,484 --> 01:34:55,051
Yeah, I know.

1682
01:34:55,053 --> 01:34:56,752
Just thought I'd bring it
with me.

1683
01:34:56,754 --> 01:34:59,321
Save on stamps.

1684
01:34:59,323 --> 01:35:00,824
All right.

1685
01:35:00,826 --> 01:35:03,294
Tony, give it here.
I'll fix it.

1686
01:35:04,328 --> 01:35:06,062
No offense, Doc,

1687
01:35:06,064 --> 01:35:09,233
but I think
I got the hang of it now.

1688
01:35:15,406 --> 01:35:17,339
"Dear Dolores:

1689
01:35:17,341 --> 01:35:20,544
"Sometimes you remind me
of a house.

1690
01:35:22,780 --> 01:35:26,448
"A house with
beautiful lights on it,

1691
01:35:26,450 --> 01:35:29,453
where everyone
is happy inside."

1692
01:35:34,358 --> 01:35:36,826
Yes, Tony. You got it.

1693
01:35:36,828 --> 01:35:39,394
Yeah?

1694
01:35:40,698 --> 01:35:43,367
Thanks.

1695
01:35:44,903 --> 01:35:49,671
Hey, Doc, thanks for helping me
with, uh, the letters.

1696
01:35:49,673 --> 01:35:52,474
You're really good
at writing 'em.

1697
01:35:52,476 --> 01:35:54,645
My pleasure, Tony.

1698
01:35:55,814 --> 01:35:57,780
You know, um,
when you get home,

1699
01:35:57,782 --> 01:36:01,719
maybe you should write...
write one to your brother.

1700
01:36:03,721 --> 01:36:06,923
He knows where I am
if he ever wants to reconnect.

1701
01:36:06,925 --> 01:36:09,627
Eh. I wouldn't wait.

1702
01:36:10,929 --> 01:36:14,429
You know, world's full
of lonely people

1703
01:36:14,431 --> 01:36:16,433
afraid to make the first move.

1704
01:36:23,809 --> 01:36:26,644
Yeah, I'll finish this
tomorrow.

1705
01:36:37,588 --> 01:36:41,590
You know, Doc, something's been
eating at me this whole trip.

1706
01:36:41,592 --> 01:36:43,561
Hmm?

1707
01:36:44,963 --> 01:36:47,931
That Titsburgh
was a major disappointment.

1708
01:36:47,933 --> 01:36:49,799
I didn't notice
any difference at all.

1709
01:36:49,801 --> 01:36:51,466
Did you?

1710
01:36:51,468 --> 01:36:53,470
Good night, Tony.

1711
01:37:04,481 --> 01:37:06,782
- Good evening.
- Welcome, welcome.

1712
01:37:06,784 --> 01:37:08,519
Come on in.

1713
01:37:10,822 --> 01:37:13,859
All righty.

1714
01:37:15,693 --> 01:37:17,526
Welcome, Mr. Shirley.

1715
01:37:17,528 --> 01:37:19,628
Graham Kindell.
I'm the general manager.

1716
01:37:19,630 --> 01:37:20,897
It is a pleasure to meet you.

1717
01:37:20,899 --> 01:37:22,631
Thank you, Mr. Kindell.

1718
01:37:22,633 --> 01:37:24,000
This is Mr. Tony Vallelonga.

1719
01:37:24,002 --> 01:37:25,767
- Nice to meet you, Tony.
- How you doing?

1720
01:37:25,769 --> 01:37:27,436
Uh, let's keep the car
right here

1721
01:37:27,438 --> 01:37:28,737
in our "guest of honor" spot.

1722
01:37:28,739 --> 01:37:30,006
Right this way, gentlemen.

1723
01:37:30,008 --> 01:37:31,773
- Hmm. Nice.
- How was your drive up?

1724
01:37:31,775 --> 01:37:32,942
Oh, it was wonderful.

1725
01:37:32,944 --> 01:37:34,610
Good to hear. Good to hear.

1726
01:37:34,612 --> 01:37:36,045
Now, as you can imagine,
our Christmas show

1727
01:37:36,047 --> 01:37:37,779
is our biggest show
of the year,

1728
01:37:37,781 --> 01:37:40,016
and we are so happy
to have you here, Mr. Shirley.

1729
01:37:40,018 --> 01:37:41,516
So, if you need anything,

1730
01:37:41,518 --> 01:37:43,518
anything at all,
you let me know.

1731
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:45,787
- Mm-hmm. Thank you.
- Now, here we are.

1732
01:37:45,789 --> 01:37:49,725
We got about an hour
before showtime. Any questions?

1733
01:37:49,727 --> 01:37:51,060
Where's the restaurant?

1734
01:37:51,062 --> 01:37:52,996
Well, you continue
down the hall here, Tony,

1735
01:37:52,998 --> 01:37:54,998
to the right
and across the lobby.

1736
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,534
- Good luck. Break a leg.
- Thank you.

1737
01:37:59,237 --> 01:38:01,470
Well, he said we got an hour.

1738
01:38:01,472 --> 01:38:02,839
You must be starving, Doc.

1739
01:38:02,841 --> 01:38:04,910
Go ahead. I'll meet you there.

1740
01:38:30,768 --> 01:38:32,436
May we join you?

1741
01:38:33,104 --> 01:38:34,973
Mm. Go ahead.

1742
01:38:40,744 --> 01:38:42,011
Cocktail, gentlemen?

1743
01:38:42,013 --> 01:38:43,712
I'm good.

1744
01:38:43,714 --> 01:38:44,948
Three shots vodka.

1745
01:38:44,950 --> 01:38:46,883
Oh.

1746
01:38:46,885 --> 01:38:49,118
Last show. Cold War over.

1747
01:38:49,120 --> 01:38:50,587
Time for truce.

1748
01:38:52,057 --> 01:38:54,057
Is Dr. Shirley
in his dressing room?

1749
01:38:54,059 --> 01:38:56,725
Yeah.
More like half a broom closet.

1750
01:38:56,727 --> 01:39:00,065
Tell you, I don't know
how he puts up with that shit.

1751
01:39:03,802 --> 01:39:07,870
Six years ago, in 1956,

1752
01:39:07,872 --> 01:39:10,572
Nat King Cole
was invited to perform

1753
01:39:10,574 --> 01:39:13,876
at the Municipal Auditorium
here in Birmingham.

1754
01:39:13,878 --> 01:39:16,879
Mr. Cole was the first Negro
asked to play

1755
01:39:16,881 --> 01:39:19,315
at a white establishment
in this city.

1756
01:39:19,317 --> 01:39:21,583
As soon as he started playing,
a group of men

1757
01:39:21,585 --> 01:39:23,754
attack him for playing
white people's music.

1758
01:39:25,090 --> 01:39:27,756
They pull him off stage

1759
01:39:27,758 --> 01:39:29,859
and beat him badly.

1760
01:39:29,861 --> 01:39:32,763
Jesus Christ.

1761
01:39:35,632 --> 01:39:40,669
You asked me once
why Dr. Shirley does this.

1762
01:39:40,671 --> 01:39:42,771
I tell you.

1763
01:39:42,773 --> 01:39:45,942
Because genius is not enough.

1764
01:39:45,944 --> 01:39:49,646
It takes courage
to change people's hearts.

1765
01:39:56,653 --> 01:39:57,822
Thanks.

1766
01:39:59,124 --> 01:40:01,790
Thank you.

1767
01:40:01,792 --> 01:40:02,925
No?

1768
01:40:05,030 --> 01:40:06,831
<i>Danke schön.</i>

1769
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
- Good evening.
- Can I help you?

1770
01:40:11,002 --> 01:40:12,536
Oh, um...

1771
01:40:15,672 --> 01:40:17,639
Um, there.
Some friends of mine.

1772
01:40:17,641 --> 01:40:20,544
Uh, y-you-you can't come
in here.

1773
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:31,020
- I understand, but...
- Hey. What's going on?

1774
01:40:31,022 --> 01:40:35,757
This... gentleman says that I'm
not permitted to dine here.

1775
01:40:35,759 --> 01:40:37,060
No, you don't understand.

1776
01:40:37,062 --> 01:40:38,727
He's playing tonight.
He's the main event.

1777
01:40:38,729 --> 01:40:40,729
- Come on.
- I-I'm sorry, but...

1778
01:40:40,731 --> 01:40:42,631
it is the policy
of the restaurant.

1779
01:40:42,633 --> 01:40:43,900
Everything all right?

1780
01:40:43,902 --> 01:40:45,700
Uh, no, it's not all right.

1781
01:40:45,702 --> 01:40:47,702
This guy's saying Dr. Shirley
can't eat here.

1782
01:40:47,704 --> 01:40:50,772
Oh, well, I apologize,
but...

1783
01:40:50,774 --> 01:40:53,176
these are long-standing
traditions, club rules.

1784
01:40:53,178 --> 01:40:54,743
I'm sure you understand.

1785
01:40:54,745 --> 01:40:56,979
No, I do not understand.

1786
01:40:56,981 --> 01:40:58,713
In 45 minutes,
I will be right up there

1787
01:40:58,715 --> 01:41:00,416
on that stage
entertaining your guests,

1788
01:41:00,418 --> 01:41:01,951
yet I can't eat here?

1789
01:41:01,953 --> 01:41:03,853
I'm sorry.

1790
01:41:03,855 --> 01:41:05,787
Wait a minute.
Are you telling me

1791
01:41:05,789 --> 01:41:07,223
the bozos in his band

1792
01:41:07,225 --> 01:41:09,992
and all these people
who came here to see him play,

1793
01:41:09,994 --> 01:41:12,661
they can eat here,
but the star of the show,

1794
01:41:12,663 --> 01:41:14,230
the-the parking spot of honor,
he can't?

1795
01:41:14,232 --> 01:41:16,731
I'm afraid not.

1796
01:41:16,733 --> 01:41:19,770
Well, he's gotta eat.
I mean, he's gotta have dinner.

1797
01:41:21,738 --> 01:41:23,738
Okay.
I'll tell you what.

1798
01:41:23,740 --> 01:41:25,774
Why don't we bring something
to his dressing room, huh?

1799
01:41:25,776 --> 01:41:27,043
John, show him a menu.

1800
01:41:27,045 --> 01:41:28,277
No.

1801
01:41:28,279 --> 01:41:31,116
I'm not eating
in that storage room.

1802
01:41:32,749 --> 01:41:34,951
Okay, uh, well, if you prefer,

1803
01:41:34,953 --> 01:41:36,285
there's a very popular
establishment

1804
01:41:36,287 --> 01:41:38,154
right down the road,
the Orange Bird,

1805
01:41:38,156 --> 01:41:40,125
they'd be happy to feed you.

1806
01:41:42,460 --> 01:41:44,894
Doc, come here.

1807
01:41:44,896 --> 01:41:46,761
Just one second, one second.

1808
01:41:46,763 --> 01:41:49,899
You know what, maybe that
other place is better anyway.

1809
01:41:49,901 --> 01:41:51,968
I mean, the dinner rolls here
are like rocks.

1810
01:41:51,970 --> 01:41:55,073
You just go over and...
you go over and come back.

1811
01:41:58,977 --> 01:42:00,977
It's the last show.

1812
01:42:00,979 --> 01:42:02,211
It's the bottom of the ninth.

1813
01:42:02,213 --> 01:42:03,946
Let's just get it over with,

1814
01:42:03,948 --> 01:42:06,715
and we can go home,
get away from these pricks.

1815
01:42:06,717 --> 01:42:08,050
Huh?

1816
01:42:08,052 --> 01:42:09,952
Ah, there you go.

1817
01:42:09,954 --> 01:42:12,257
The fish is wonderful tonight.

1818
01:42:17,262 --> 01:42:20,496
Either I eat in this room,

1819
01:42:20,498 --> 01:42:22,967
or I'm not performing tonight.

1820
01:42:26,804 --> 01:42:29,274
May I have a word with you?

1821
01:42:34,279 --> 01:42:35,947
No.

1822
01:42:41,119 --> 01:42:43,953
Mr. Villanueva,

1823
01:42:43,955 --> 01:42:46,055
you have to talk sense
to Mr. Shirley.

1824
01:42:46,057 --> 01:42:47,323
Please make him understand.

1825
01:42:47,325 --> 01:42:49,058
We're not insulting him
personally.

1826
01:42:49,060 --> 01:42:51,093
This is just the way
things are done down here.

1827
01:42:51,095 --> 01:42:53,029
Yeah, well,
he's not from down here.

1828
01:42:53,031 --> 01:42:55,164
Yeah, just-just ask him
to be reasonable.

1829
01:42:55,166 --> 01:42:56,799
I got 400 guests in there

1830
01:42:56,801 --> 01:42:58,034
expecting to be entertained
tonight.

1831
01:42:58,036 --> 01:43:00,269
And Dr. Shirley expects
to eat tonight.

1832
01:43:00,271 --> 01:43:02,974
Why can't you just make
an exception this one time?

1833
01:43:04,375 --> 01:43:06,976
Let me tell you a story.

1834
01:43:06,978 --> 01:43:10,313
You ever hear of the
Boston Celtics basketball club?

1835
01:43:10,315 --> 01:43:11,347
- Yeah.
- Well...

1836
01:43:11,349 --> 01:43:12,982
those boys came through here

1837
01:43:12,984 --> 01:43:15,117
couple years ago
on a barnstorming tour, and...

1838
01:43:15,119 --> 01:43:16,986
seeing as they was
the world champions

1839
01:43:16,988 --> 01:43:19,288
of the league and all, we were
tickled to have them here,

1840
01:43:19,290 --> 01:43:21,123
and we rolled out
the welcome wagon.

1841
01:43:21,125 --> 01:43:22,825
So, do you know what table

1842
01:43:22,827 --> 01:43:24,994
their big coon ate at
that night?

1843
01:43:24,996 --> 01:43:26,996
No.

1844
01:43:26,998 --> 01:43:30,132
I don't, either,
but it wasn't one of ours.

1845
01:43:30,134 --> 01:43:32,268
Now, let's cut the bullshit.

1846
01:43:32,270 --> 01:43:34,170
Tell me what it's
gonna take, huh?

1847
01:43:34,172 --> 01:43:36,874
Say, uh, a hundred dollars,
you get your boy to play?

1848
01:43:38,876 --> 01:43:40,876
You think you can buy me?

1849
01:43:40,878 --> 01:43:42,812
With all due respect, sir,

1850
01:43:42,814 --> 01:43:45,381
you wouldn't be in a job like
this if you couldn't be bought.

1851
01:43:45,383 --> 01:43:47,383
Stop.

1852
01:43:47,385 --> 01:43:48,953
Tony.

1853
01:43:50,255 --> 01:43:52,023
It's all right.

1854
01:43:54,058 --> 01:43:58,830
I'll play if you want me to.

1855
01:44:12,110 --> 01:44:13,309
All right.

1856
01:44:13,311 --> 01:44:15,046
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1857
01:44:16,314 --> 01:44:18,914
What do you mean,
"Let's get out of here"?

1858
01:44:18,916 --> 01:44:20,916
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

1859
01:44:20,918 --> 01:44:23,185
Don, don't do this. Now, you
signed a contract, and I...

1860
01:44:23,187 --> 01:44:25,421
I know you're the kind of man
who honors a contract.

1861
01:44:25,423 --> 01:44:27,456
Connie, Bill, everything's
gonna be fine. It's all right.

1862
01:44:27,458 --> 01:44:29,425
You got a show to do, mister.

1863
01:44:29,427 --> 01:44:31,193
You turn yourself around
right now, goddamn it!

1864
01:44:31,195 --> 01:44:33,296
Right now!

1865
01:44:33,298 --> 01:44:35,364
This is why you people
don't work down here.

1866
01:44:35,366 --> 01:44:37,333
'Cause you're unreliable,
you hear me?

1867
01:44:37,335 --> 01:44:40,805
I shipped that goddamn Steinway
in from Atlanta for you!

1868
01:44:48,012 --> 01:44:51,213
Tony, are you hungry?

1869
01:44:51,215 --> 01:44:53,951
Does Betty like butta... er?

1870
01:44:57,355 --> 01:45:00,890
<i>One, two...</i>

1871
01:45:38,029 --> 01:45:39,929
You a cop?

1872
01:45:39,931 --> 01:45:41,432
Do I look Irish?

1873
01:45:42,467 --> 01:45:44,033
What you want, baby?

1874
01:45:44,035 --> 01:45:45,434
Two Cutty Sarks, neat.

1875
01:45:45,436 --> 01:45:47,138
Coming up.

1876
01:45:54,011 --> 01:45:56,948
Mm. Whatever your
specialty is, we'll take it.

1877
01:45:58,015 --> 01:46:00,017
Two Orange Birds!

1878
01:46:12,029 --> 01:46:14,430
I like what you did
back there, Doc.

1879
01:46:14,432 --> 01:46:16,901
You stood up for yourself.

1880
01:46:18,503 --> 01:46:21,003
It's like what your friend,
the president, said.

1881
01:46:21,005 --> 01:46:23,472
"Ask not...

1882
01:46:23,474 --> 01:46:27,042
"your country
what you can do for it.

1883
01:46:27,044 --> 01:46:29,247
Ask what you do for yourself."

1884
01:46:30,314 --> 01:46:32,417
You know?

1885
01:46:33,985 --> 01:46:36,552
So, darling, what you do?

1886
01:46:36,554 --> 01:46:38,287
All dressed up like that.

1887
01:46:38,289 --> 01:46:40,256
Nothing particularly important.

1888
01:46:42,059 --> 01:46:43,492
Shouldn't judge a man
by his clothes.

1889
01:46:44,562 --> 01:46:47,496
He's only the greatest
piano player in the world.

1890
01:46:47,498 --> 01:46:49,064
That right?

1891
01:46:49,066 --> 01:46:51,066
You good?

1892
01:46:51,068 --> 01:46:53,402
Don't be shy, Doc.

1893
01:46:53,404 --> 01:46:55,104
Tell her who you are.

1894
01:46:55,106 --> 01:46:56,539
Don't tell me nothing.

1895
01:46:56,541 --> 01:46:58,476
Show me.

1896
01:47:04,282 --> 01:47:06,217
Come on.

1897
01:48:52,323 --> 01:48:55,560
Yeah! Yeah!

1898
01:50:24,548 --> 01:50:26,615
That's how you break a key.

1899
01:50:29,286 --> 01:50:30,686
Oh, that was a good time.

1900
01:50:30,688 --> 01:50:32,688
I'd do that once a month
for free.

1901
01:50:32,690 --> 01:50:34,323
You were unbelievable.

1902
01:50:34,325 --> 01:50:35,724
Hey, Tony.

1903
01:50:35,726 --> 01:50:38,560
I bet, if we leave right now,
we can make it.

1904
01:50:38,562 --> 01:50:39,829
Make what?

1905
01:50:39,831 --> 01:50:42,566
Christmas Eve,
in New York City.

1906
01:50:47,005 --> 01:50:48,671
Oh, shit!

1907
01:50:58,416 --> 01:51:02,186
Don't ever flash
your wad of cash in a bar.

1908
01:51:10,862 --> 01:51:13,462
I knew you had a gun.

1909
01:51:14,532 --> 01:51:17,201
♪ No more heartaches

1910
01:51:18,335 --> 01:51:21,603

1916
01:51:38,355 --> 01:51:40,489
This could get bad, Doc.

1917
01:51:40,491 --> 01:51:41,757
Yes.

1918
01:51:41,759 --> 01:51:43,692
It's a shame we don't
have something

1919
01:51:43,694 --> 01:51:45,761
to protect us on our journey.

1920
01:51:45,763 --> 01:51:47,831
Oh, I know.

1921
01:51:47,833 --> 01:51:51,368
Why don't you put your lucky
rock up on the dash, Tony?

1922
01:51:53,370 --> 01:51:54,770
Come on, Tony.
