2
00:03:27,873 --> 00:03:29,353
Come on, we're at Pondolem.

3
00:03:30,475 --> 00:03:31,853
Let's go, Pondolem.

4
00:03:35,747 --> 00:03:37,283
Let's go, Pondolem.

5
00:03:43,088 --> 00:03:44,260
Be careful, Peter.

6
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,228
Breakfast or beer?

7
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,867
Where's Pondolem police station?
The new one?

8
00:03:52,064 --> 00:03:53,771
Are you a police officer?
- Yes.

9
00:03:55,701 --> 00:03:57,146
Here it is. Right in front of us.

10
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:00,377
It was inaugurated just last week.
- I see.

11
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:04,182
The faded one right next to it
is the old police station.

12
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,288
Okay, thanks.

13
00:04:06,545 --> 00:04:08,752
All the police officers have
breakfast here.

14
00:04:09,147 --> 00:04:12,186
Some of them eat breakfast,
lunch and dinner right here.

15
00:04:12,618 --> 00:04:13,688
I see.

16
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,264
Come over, after duty hours.

17
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:17,764
<i>I'll</i> serve you chilled beer
and fried fish.

18
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,033
Let's see.

19
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:30,843
Excuse me.

20
00:04:31,403 --> 00:04:33,178
Who's the Senior Pl'?

21
00:04:33,372 --> 00:04:34,976
Who are you?
- Satish Naik.

22
00:04:35,207 --> 00:04:36,687
I have been transferred here.

23
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:38,579
Sir, do come in.
You're welcome.

24
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,584
Have a seat.
Sir will be here, soon.

25
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:55,566
Listen.

26
00:04:57,529 --> 00:04:59,600
Isn't that Vijay Salgaonkar'?

27
00:04:59,798 --> 00:05:01,800
Yes, sir.
That's him.

28
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,012
He seems to be pretty
straight forward.

29
00:05:04,336 --> 00:05:07,511
But, appearances can
be deceptive, sir.

30
00:05:07,572 --> 00:05:10,985
What do you mean?
- I mean, what he's done...

31
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:12,713
...is still pretty unbelievable.

32
00:05:45,077 --> 00:05:46,351
Vijay, sir.

33
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,557
Get him, get him. Hey, hey, hey.

34
00:05:51,283 --> 00:05:52,627
Go.

35
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:03,331
That was an awesome chase, sir!

36
00:06:03,528 --> 00:06:04,632
Awesome?

37
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,168
They've edited it with fast cuts
and taken the audience for a ride.

38
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:08,540
On top of that, the music
is pounding away!

39
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,180
So that it seems as if
a lot is going on.

40
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:11,975
But, nothing is really happening.

41
00:06:12,204 --> 00:06:13,581
You need to feel
the tension. Feel it!

42
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:16,175
Mr. Vijay, I have an idea.

43
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:17,915
You know, you should make
a movie.

44
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:20,353
I mean, then the world will see
that you...

45
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,192
<i>I'll</i> show it to you, first.
- No!

46
00:06:22,247 --> 00:06:24,057
Mr. Vijay! No! Sorry, sir!

47
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,194
Are you done
with the collections?

48
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,230
Yes, I'm done.
Here, look.

49
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:31,228
As always, Inspector
Gaitonde cribbed a bit.

50
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,826
And, uncle Pinto's TV
is flickering.

51
00:06:33,925 --> 00:06:36,235
That's a problem with his TV.
It's not a cable issue.

52
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,800
Tell him to buy a new one.
- You bet, I did!

53
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,542
<i>Then?</i>
<i>"k-k-k</i>

54
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:45,081
That's what he called you.
- And you let him abuse me'?

55
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:47,478
No, no, I didn't!
I told him.

56
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,987
I said, if you want to abuse
Mr. Vijay...

57
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:52,386
...say something logical.

58
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,119
You can call him uneducated,
illiterate, 4th grade dropout...

59
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:59,593
...call him an orphan.
But, â€œ*7 No, never.

60
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,961
Am I right'?
Or am I right'?

61
00:07:02,187 --> 00:07:03,826
Alright, then!
- Listen to me.

62
00:07:04,055 --> 00:07:06,730
You're absolutely right.
<i>I'll</i> give you a bonus. - A bonus!

63
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,096
Mr. Vijay, no! Sir, no!

64
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,646
He's waiting for SI Gaitonde.

65
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:26,420
Why?
- Don't ask.

66
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:29,559
He locked up
his only son in prison.

67
00:07:30,415 --> 00:07:31,588
What did he do'?

68
00:07:32,317 --> 00:07:35,560
Nothing. He took a loan from
a private finance company.

69
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,827
He used to pay all
the installments on time.

70
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:40,663
He just wasn't able to pay
the final installment.

71
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:44,170
Mr. Gaitonde took my
son away, two days ago.

72
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,534
Now, the finance company
is also saying...

73
00:07:46,731 --> 00:07:49,269
...that, the installment has to be
paid with interest, first.

74
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,237
That's when they'll let my
son go.

75
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,012
Why is Gaitonde taking such an
interest in this?

76
00:07:55,207 --> 00:07:58,314
Because, his cousin runs
the finance company.

77
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:00,720
So, did you complain
to Mr. Prabhu'?

78
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:02,918
Mr. Gaitonde told me...

79
00:08:03,348 --> 00:08:05,555
...if I complain to anyone
at all...

80
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,127
...then, he will kill my son.

81
00:08:08,353 --> 00:08:10,459
Anyway, what's 'the point oi
complaining?

82
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,658
Then, file a lawsuit in the court.

83
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,601
On whom'?

84
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,334
His son wasn't locked up
by the finance company...

85
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:19,867
...Gaitonde did that.

86
00:08:22,033 --> 00:08:24,377
'There is only one way
to get your brother out.'

87
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,540
'What's that?
- Habeas corpus.'

88
00:08:27,305 --> 00:08:30,014
<i>I'll</i> tell you what to do.
Habeas corpus.

89
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,680
What'? Hibbus...

90
00:08:31,843 --> 00:08:33,880
Habeas corpus.
It's a legal 'term.

91
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:35,217
How will that help?

92
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,955
His son will get
released, because...

93
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:39,859
'This is not an ordinary case.'

94
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:41,057
'This is a case
involving habeas corpus.'

95
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,655
And if they tell the court...

96
00:08:42,754 --> 00:08:45,565
mthat someone has locked up
his son illegally...

97
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,764
...then, the court will order the
police to at once...

98
00:08:47,826 --> 00:08:50,330
...present the man in the
court.'

99
00:08:50,428 --> 00:08:54,536
Then, Gaitonde or 'the senior Pl
or IG, can't ignore 'the court's order.

100
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,977
The police will not present him
in the court.

101
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,515
Because Gaitonde locked him up
illegally.

102
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:02,582
Why don't you do this?
I know a lawyer in Panaji.

103
00:09:02,741 --> 00:09:04,880
Shirish Kamath.
<i>I'll</i> give you his number.

104
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,687
Tell him, this is a matter
concerning Habeas corpus.

105
00:09:07,846 --> 00:09:09,190
I will speak to him, too.

106
00:09:11,283 --> 00:09:13,524
Speak of the devil
and the devil appears!

107
00:09:13,818 --> 00:09:15,321
He's coming this way.

108
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:16,764
You have to get out of here.

109
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:18,596
Leave, by the back door.

110
00:09:24,496 --> 00:09:25,942
Hey, Martin!
- Hmm.

111
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:27,875
Did an old couple come here?

112
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,837
Not at all.
- Where the heck did they go?

113
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,187
What do you think'?

114
00:09:46,418 --> 00:09:48,399
Are you the only
one who can act'?

115
00:09:48,553 --> 00:09:51,398
Today, I have managed
to act, somehow.

116
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,161
I love you, dad.

117
00:09:53,491 --> 00:09:55,630
Come on, and wipe your
tears, dad.

118
00:09:55,727 --> 00:09:57,105
Here's the handkerchief.

119
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:58,969
Wipe your tears!

120
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,634
You now carry a handkerchief
in your pocket'?

121
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:06,178
Sumi! I don't have to
worry about anything!

122
00:10:06,605 --> 00:10:08,380
Your son is very responsible, now.
- Mr. Vijay.

123
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:09,817
Mr. vijav!

124
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,485
Mr. Vijay, can I go home?
lfs really late.

125
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:14,514
Thank you.

126
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,623
Hello? Mirage Cable.

127
00:10:23,254 --> 00:10:24,893
Yes, yes, yes.

128
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:26,999
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

129
00:10:27,092 --> 00:10:28,629
<i>Yes, I'll</i> do that.
<i>I'll</i> do <i>it.</i>

130
00:10:28,727 --> 00:10:30,673
Right away! Yes. Yes!

131
00:10:32,163 --> 00:10:34,201
Seems you received quiet a drubbing.
What is it'?

132
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:35,802
Actually, ifs aunt Saldanha...

133
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:38,871
...the amplifier near her
place is not working. So I am...

134
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:41,240
You just changed that
three days ago.

135
00:10:41,573 --> 00:10:43,211
I forgot about that.

136
00:10:43,908 --> 00:10:45,513
That's nice, you deserve
the drubbing.

137
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:47,246
I am going there, at once.

138
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,594
What else did you forget'?

139
00:10:52,684 --> 00:10:54,494
Hello, I... I...

140
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:58,258
Yes, done, done.

141
00:11:00,725 --> 00:11:03,365
Mr. Shirodkar who is 75 years
old has a request.

142
00:11:03,461 --> 00:11:06,272
Screen a nice, adult
movie, today.

143
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:09,378
But, wasn't he paralyzed?

144
00:11:10,101 --> 00:11:13,048
Come on, Mr. Vijay!
His left side is paralyzed.

145
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,140
Whereas Shirodkar is
right handed.

146
00:11:15,206 --> 00:11:17,312
Get lost! Scat!
- No, I'm going.

147
00:11:17,475 --> 00:11:20,423
We can't lose, dad.
We have to win.

148
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,355
I love you, dad.

149
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:24,956
My son.

150
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:56,393
Good morning.
- Good morning.

151
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:59,125
How are the studies coming along?
- Doing fine.

152
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,827
Where is mom'?
- In the kitchen.

153
00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:18,676
Where are the keys to the vault?
Tell me the truth!

154
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:22,179
Which vault'? I really don't know.
Let me go, please.

155
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,187
Who knows, if you don't'?

156
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,857
Vijay. __
- Who's vuav?

157
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,424
The man who's threatening
me with a carrot.

158
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:34,563
And, it seems, he hasn't
even bathed, yet.

159
00:12:35,053 --> 00:12:36,828
You're reeking of sweat.

160
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,798
I would bathe, if you heat the
water.

161
00:12:40,024 --> 00:12:42,471
Check in 'the bathroom.
It's already 'there.

162
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,841
You come too.
- Get away! Naughty!

163
00:12:51,302 --> 00:12:52,475
Go!

164
00:12:58,009 --> 00:12:59,511
So, where's Miss India?

165
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,950
She's probably rehearsing her
cat walk in front of the mirror.

166
00:13:02,347 --> 00:13:04,384
Anu!
- <i>I'll</i> be right there, mom.

167
00:13:05,183 --> 00:13:07,754
Good morning, dad.
- Good morning.

168
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:13,335
I was calling you last night.
But, I couldn't get through.

169
00:13:13,558 --> 00:13:16,596
Did the phone die on you again?
- Yes.

170
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:19,039
Why don't you buy a cell phone?

171
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,479
What's the use?
That place is out of range.

172
00:13:22,534 --> 00:13:26,312
Really? So, how does Jose
get the range on his mobile?

173
00:13:26,838 --> 00:13:30,342
Ifs not like that. You want an
excuse to be away from us.

174
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:33,052
The three of us stay here
alone and you are...

175
00:13:33,111 --> 00:13:37,288
One moment. Since there are
three of you, you're not alone.

176
00:13:40,451 --> 00:13:42,125
Don't crack silly jokes.

177
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:45,561
You'd rather sit in office
and watch movies than come home.

178
00:13:47,091 --> 00:13:49,470
You don't have any
sense of responsibility towards us.

179
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:51,801
You should consider us,
at least.

180
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,673
Okay, fine.
What do you want'?

181
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,181
My darling wife! Speak up!

182
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,885
We want to go to Panaji.

183
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:08,857
Why?

184
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:10,592
For shopping-

185
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:13,756
We just went shopping,
six months ago.

186
00:14:15,453 --> 00:14:16,489
Yes, we did shop.

187
00:14:16,588 --> 00:14:19,125
You bought the cheapest
clothes, to save money.

188
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:21,296
Their colors have faded,
within six months.

189
00:14:21,626 --> 00:14:24,971
So, 'this 'time, let's shop here,
instead oi going 'to Panaji.

190
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:28,134
No! We want to go to Panaji.

191
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,006
We don't just want to shop.

192
00:14:30,101 --> 00:14:32,013
We also want to watch a movie.

193
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:34,482
And we want to eat a pizza too.

194
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:37,312
And ice cream?
- Yes, ice cream, too!

195
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:44,584
People do all sorts oi things
'for their 'family. What do you do?

196
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:47,019
You can't even buy us
an ice cream!

197
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:48,562
Don't be so absurd!

198
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:50,562
You can buy ice cream
at Martin's too!

199
00:14:50,755 --> 00:14:51,961
What's so special about Panaji'?

200
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,263
You're denying our wishes.
Correct?

201
00:14:54,092 --> 00:14:56,835
Majority wins and you're
still saying no!

202
00:14:57,528 --> 00:14:58,836
We shall see.

203
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:00,844
I didn't say no.

204
00:15:01,299 --> 00:15:02,711
I just asked.

205
00:15:02,967 --> 00:15:04,708
Does that mean, we're
going to Panap'?

206
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:06,677
Yes.
- Are you sure'?

207
00:15:06,871 --> 00:15:08,817
This Sunday, we are going
to Panaji.

208
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:10,077
Happy?

209
00:15:24,856 --> 00:15:28,736
"What is it about you, life?"

210
00:15:34,732 --> 00:15:38,875
"What is it about you, life?"

211
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:44,577
"Am I a copy of you?"

212
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:50,784
"Or, do you reflect me?"

213
00:16:00,558 --> 00:16:04,506
"What is it about you, life?"

214
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:10,143
"What is it about you, life?"

215
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:35,133
"You are clinging to me."

216
00:16:35,927 --> 00:16:40,240
"You tickle my soles."

217
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:44,503
"You are a little irritable."

218
00:16:45,803 --> 00:16:48,807
"You are slightly arrogant."

219
00:16:50,942 --> 00:16:53,514
"You argue with me."

220
00:16:53,912 --> 00:17:00,090
"Let's meet little further
down the road."

221
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:08,904
"What is it about you, life?"

222
00:17:23,307 --> 00:17:25,810
There's a nature camp,
the next week.

223
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:29,755
And, two students from
each school in Goa are selected.

224
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:33,594
And, I've been selected
from my school.

225
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:35,320
That's really nice.

226
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,401
Yes, but.

227
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,330
I've told her, she can't go.

228
00:17:39,557 --> 00:17:40,763
Why?

229
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,603
She should go for a nature camp.

230
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:45,865
Nandini, real knowledge
is not found only in books.

231
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,509
You have to visit new places
for that.

232
00:17:47,598 --> 00:17:48,702
You have to meet different
kinds of people.

233
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,040
You have to experience
new things.

234
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,383
In that case, why don't
you pay the fees'?

235
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,844
The fees'?
- Rs. 1800.

236
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,259
I think, real knowledge
is found only in books.

237
00:18:06,884 --> 00:18:09,092
What'? You just said yes!

238
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,959
You can't go back on your word.

239
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:15,832
Please, let me do this.
Please?

240
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:17,770
Okay, fine.
- Thank you!

241
00:18:17,829 --> 00:18:21,971
"A frown comes along
in the middle of a laugh."

242
00:18:22,867 --> 00:18:28,010
"Just let me catch my breath."

243
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:34,686
"All the autumn leaves
will fall away."

244
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:41,728
"Let me understand this."

245
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:46,902
"A bit of a firecracker."

246
00:18:47,859 --> 00:18:51,432
"A bit sprightly and teasing."

247
00:18:52,964 --> 00:18:56,605
"You are a chain that ties me
down."

248
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:02,249
"Why don't you turn
back to me, some time?"

249
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:17,493
"What is it about you, life?"

250
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:33,573
"What is it about you, life?"

251
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:43,859
"What is it about you, life?"

252
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:48,922
"Am I a copy of you?"

253
00:19:50,454 --> 00:19:55,461
"Or, do you reflect me?"

254
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:02,638
Mr. Vijay! It's been so long!

255
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,075
How are you, Rajesh?
- Fine.

256
00:20:04,135 --> 00:20:05,672
How's the social work going on?
- Well...

257
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:08,182
There's more politics
than social work involved.

258
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:11,412
Right. Our group has established
a political party.

259
00:20:11,576 --> 00:20:12,920
The Goa Jana Party.

260
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,512
I'm working on that.

261
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:15,887
What's that in your hand?

262
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:19,861
There is a stone quarry about
15 kms away in Paavelim.

263
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:20,996
I mean, it was there, earlier.

264
00:20:21,185 --> 00:20:23,257
We shut it down
after protesting against it.

265
00:20:23,788 --> 00:20:26,269
Why?
- The project is not eco friendly.

266
00:20:26,657 --> 00:20:29,832
There is a lake right in the
middle of the quarry. Have a look.

267
00:20:30,261 --> 00:20:31,673
Alright, I've got to leave.

268
00:20:31,762 --> 00:20:33,037
See you.
- Bye Sis!

269
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:38,471
So, as I was saying...

270
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:40,141
...the girls are growing up.

271
00:20:40,204 --> 00:20:41,240
They are smart, too.

272
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:43,411
They should get into
a good school.

273
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:45,083
For example..
- St. Thomas.

274
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,086
St. Thomas.

275
00:20:47,445 --> 00:20:50,289
I've heard very good things
about that school.

276
00:20:50,781 --> 00:20:53,285
From whom'?
From Nandini, right'?

277
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:56,758
Yes, I told her.
So what'?

278
00:20:57,355 --> 00:20:57,992
I knew it.

279
00:20:58,089 --> 00:21:00,069
Only you can come up with
such an uneducated idea.

280
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,604
Who are you calling uneducated?

281
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,195
I'm more educated than you.

282
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:05,104
Right, you've got a doctorate.

283
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:06,834
I admit, I only studied
till the tenth grade.

284
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:08,305
But at least, I cleared the exams!

285
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,644
I didn't fail in the
fourth grade, like you.

286
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:12,210
That's where you're wrong.

287
00:21:12,403 --> 00:21:14,179
Clearing papers doesn't teach you
everything.

288
00:21:14,338 --> 00:21:15,875
What'?
- You bet!

289
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,980
Once, it took me four
whole hours to explain to her...

290
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:21,455
mthat, Sonu Nigam's brother
isn't called Telephone Nigam.

291
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:23,183
She just wouldn't believe me.

292
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,461
Just keep quiet!
You always..

293
00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:28,258
Listen, please don't get
into another tight the both ot you!

294
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:30,965
And you don't need to go to
St. Thomas to know all that.

295
00:21:31,155 --> 00:21:34,000
At least, don't scrimp
when it comes to education.

296
00:21:34,425 --> 00:21:35,996
I'm not scrimping.
I'm being sensible.

297
00:21:36,193 --> 00:21:38,140
Ifs not necessary everything
that is expensive is good.

298
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,136
Besides, those who really
wish to study...

299
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:42,505
...can study at any school
and make it big.

300
00:21:42,733 --> 00:21:44,111
What do you say, Fatherfin-law)?
Am I right'?

301
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:47,816
Yes, my son.
You're absolutely right. Right.

302
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:52,319
Get it moving, quickly.

303
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:55,016
Hello, Plane!
- Hello, uncle Martin! How are you?

304
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:56,387
Okay.
- What brings you here?

305
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:59,223
So, 'the work has begun.
- Yes, it'll be done, soon.

306
00:22:15,433 --> 00:22:16,810
Are you done with the
collections?

307
00:22:17,702 --> 00:22:18,738
Yes, you bet!

308
00:22:18,903 --> 00:22:21,680
What about D'costa and Bandodkafs
complaints?

309
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:23,742
Yes, I'm on my way there.

310
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,821
Then, leave!
- Of course, <i>I'll</i> go.

311
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:27,747
I really want you to leave!
- Yes.

312
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,923
Let me finish my special tea.

313
00:22:30,915 --> 00:22:32,361
Where is it'?
- Here...

314
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,824
Peter! Hey, Peter!

315
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,798
Where's my special tea'?

316
00:22:39,557 --> 00:22:42,334
You! - No, no! Behind you, sir!
I'm leaving!

317
00:22:42,993 --> 00:22:44,336
Hey!
" Crazy!

318
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:47,208
Is he crazy?

319
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:48,604
What's the matter, Vijay?

320
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,479
He's getting too smart
for his own good.

321
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:52,838
Forget about it.
He's a kid.

322
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:57,343
Listen, Mr. Plane, 'this is
Mr. Vijay Salgaonkar.

323
00:22:57,875 --> 00:23:01,221
He owns Mirage Cable.
- Really? That's nice.

324
00:23:01,278 --> 00:23:02,758
This is contractor Plane.

325
00:23:02,847 --> 00:23:04,384
He is working on 'the construction
oi 'the police station.

326
00:23:04,548 --> 00:23:06,050
Okay, okay.
Do come in.

327
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,355
After you.
- Sit down.

328
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:18,836
Uncle Martin said you
need to get some odd jobs done.

329
00:23:19,597 --> 00:23:21,838
I have a...
- Hey, Martin!

330
00:23:21,932 --> 00:23:24,641
I asked you it that old couple
came over the other day.

331
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:26,042
You said no.

332
00:23:26,137 --> 00:23:28,140
You think I am some...?

333
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:30,748
I know, they came here.

334
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:34,789
Some smart chap taught them
a few legal lessons.

335
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:36,449
What the heck!

336
00:23:36,647 --> 00:23:39,753
What are you saying?
I don't remember anything.

337
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:42,989
Really? So, your
memory is failing.

338
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:45,827
Or, are you trying to
protect that wise guy'?

339
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:48,400
Listen, I'm an old man.

340
00:23:48,859 --> 00:23:50,931
Right. Old man.

341
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,743
So, Vijay. Do you remember
the old couple?

342
00:23:58,702 --> 00:24:00,079
Which old couple?

343
00:24:03,107 --> 00:24:05,519
Hey, Peter'?
What's on the menu today?

344
00:24:05,576 --> 00:24:07,921
The usual.

345
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:11,784
What is this, uncle? You should
have a today's special!

346
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,924
I'm fed up of eating
the same food, every day.

347
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:15,290
What to do, son?

348
00:24:15,653 --> 00:24:17,429
I am bored, too.
- See'?

349
00:24:17,721 --> 00:24:20,759
But normally, my customers
pay for their meals later.

350
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:24,304
Some of them, even eat
free of cost.

351
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:25,807
Right.

352
00:24:27,164 --> 00:24:28,609
For example, Vijay.

353
00:24:30,734 --> 00:24:32,737
I don't pay for
my meals, later.

354
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:35,710
I clear my bills every week.

355
00:24:37,741 --> 00:24:40,951
So, that means you're
taunting me, uncle.

356
00:24:41,145 --> 00:24:43,182
No, no! Just talking
in general.

357
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:45,454
No, let's settle your account
today.

358
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,458
Why do you keep going
on and on about money?

359
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,222
What will you do
with all that money?

360
00:24:50,855 --> 00:24:53,393
<i>I'll</i> put a today's special
on the menu.

361
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,834
Really? How much do
I owe you?

362
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,436
Forget about it, sir.
Forget it.

363
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,000
Take it, uncle.

364
00:25:02,233 --> 00:25:04,737
When a cop offers to pay,
you should take it at once.

365
00:25:05,069 --> 00:25:06,810
Just keep your nose out of this.

366
00:25:07,972 --> 00:25:09,042
Cheeky fellow!

367
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,548
We're having it out, here.

368
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:12,979
So, how much do I owe you?
Don't feel shy, tell me.

369
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:14,848
Rs. 3542.

370
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,914
So, you remember that
number really well!

371
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,585
But, you don't remember that
old couple!

372
00:25:18,782 --> 00:25:21,388
I write my accounts
down, you see.

373
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:22,759
Okay, fine.

374
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:26,230
Rs. 3542. That's it'?!

375
00:25:26,423 --> 00:25:29,132
Cheapskate!
Rs. 3600.

376
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:30,968
Let's make it a round figure.

377
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:33,102
I'm going to settle it,
right away.

378
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:34,674
Uncle, let's just assume...

379
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,106
...you've paid me Rs. 3600
as commission.

380
00:25:37,301 --> 00:25:38,747
What's the commission for'?

381
00:25:40,204 --> 00:25:41,512
Don't you see that
right in front'?

382
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:44,175
The new police station
is being constructed.

383
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:46,048
So, all the workers
from there...

384
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,848
...come here to eat
food.

385
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,354
Why?

386
00:25:49,713 --> 00:25:50,920
Thanks to me.

387
00:25:51,215 --> 00:25:53,923
Look at that! Contractor
Rane is sitting here, too.

388
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:55,623
What's up, Rene'?

389
00:25:56,253 --> 00:25:58,063
I have given you so many
customers...

390
00:25:58,656 --> 00:26:00,829
...so, I should get paid a
commission tor that, uncle.

391
00:26:02,326 --> 00:26:04,272
These days, at our police
station...

392
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:07,035
we are observing
'the police is your friend' week.

393
00:26:13,971 --> 00:26:16,144
The police really know
how to eat well.

394
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,144
At least, work out a bit.

395
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:20,618
What's your problem?

396
00:26:24,715 --> 00:26:26,626
There is no other hotel
around here, except this one.

397
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,826
That's why the construction
workers come here to eat.

398
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:31,728
You're not needed for that.

399
00:26:32,156 --> 00:26:33,659
I am a cop.

400
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:36,098
I can stop them from coming here.

401
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:40,771
Hello, Martin!
- Hello, sir.

402
00:26:41,031 --> 00:26:43,011
Peter, get Mr. Sawant some
coffee.

403
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:46,506
Vijay, how are you doing'?

404
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:49,715
We were working out a deal.

405
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,317
We just settled on the commission.

406
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:52,749
What's the commission for'?

407
00:26:53,243 --> 00:26:56,884
<i>For 'the meals o'f 'the construction</i>
<i>workers at 'the new police station.</i>

408
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:58,590
Who's taking a commission?

409
00:27:02,953 --> 00:27:04,490
Mr. Sawant, coffee.

410
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:05,996
Yes.

411
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:09,601
Mr. Sawant, I know,
I should not be saying this.

412
00:27:09,994 --> 00:27:12,601
What's the meaning of
the police is your friend week?

413
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:17,439
<i>It's 'the</i> duty <i>oi 'the police 'to
be friendly</i> and <i>help 'the public.</i>

414
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,839
Then, why is it being done
for a week, in the whole year?

415
00:27:21,972 --> 00:27:23,316
You ' re right, Vijay.

416
00:27:24,174 --> 00:27:28,520
But, until the people are scared to
file complaints, ifs impossible.

417
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:30,914
That's why, we're doing
all this.

418
00:27:31,115 --> 00:27:32,527
It will sort itself
out, gradually.

419
00:27:34,051 --> 00:27:36,395
But, all police officers
aren't like you, sir.

420
00:27:37,588 --> 00:27:40,068
Some are big, black bed bugs...

421
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:42,372
...who can only feed off
other people's blood.

422
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,287
What are you doing?

423
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,290
I'm digging a pit for
the compost.

424
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:07,893
You know what'? Compost and
speed post are <i>2</i> different things.

425
00:28:07,951 --> 00:28:09,727
I know what compost means.

426
00:28:09,887 --> 00:28:14,165
H' you bury dry leaves and organic
garbage for six months...

427
00:28:14,358 --> 00:28:15,962
...it turns into fertilizer.

428
00:28:16,193 --> 00:28:17,605
I learnt that in school.

429
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:21,772
I just came to tell you that...

430
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,642
mnext weekend on 2nd
and 3rd October...

431
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:26,546
...Swami Chinmayanand is holding
sermons in Panaji.

432
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,983
So'?
- So, we should go!

433
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:31,486
Ifs been a year since we heard
him preach. - You go ahead.

434
00:28:31,542 --> 00:28:33,181
Either we go together, or nobody does.
- Mom!

435
00:28:33,243 --> 00:28:35,747
I won't spare you! Mom can't save you.
- Mom!

436
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:37,289
Come here.
- Mom! No!

437
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,917
Come here.
- Anju.

438
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,152
We spent so much
to send you on a nature camp.

439
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:42,963
You didn't tell us about it.

440
00:28:43,153 --> 00:28:45,656
It was great fun! There were
students from 4O schools.

441
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:48,760
We went sightseeing, had a bonfire,
we sang songs.

442
00:28:48,826 --> 00:28:50,101
And we had a lot of fun.

443
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:52,505
There were kids from
VIP families too.

444
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,105
One of them was called Sam.

445
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:57,973
He used to keep shooting
videos of girls with his phone.

446
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:00,174
Did he shoot you, too'?

447
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,218
Yes.
- Why didn't you complain?

448
00:29:02,406 --> 00:29:05,854
Later, an advocate's daughter
scolded him.

449
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:07,421
Then, he stopped it.

450
00:29:07,511 --> 00:29:08,923
Which school was he from'?

451
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:10,115
St. Thomas.

452
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:23,366
Is this an old construction?
- Yes.

453
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,134
No wonder the foundation
has crumbled.

454
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,309
Don't worry, it will get done.

455
00:29:28,365 --> 00:29:29,435
Ifs just a day's work.

456
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,038
Then, do it whenever you have time.
- Okay.

457
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:34,876
The slab laying work at the police
station is done.

458
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:37,174
I have to start the flooring
from Monday.

459
00:29:37,241 --> 00:29:39,586
So, once that's done,
we'll get this done. Okay?

460
00:29:39,877 --> 00:29:41,084
Okay, thank you.

461
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:45,920
I would have taken
the money from any other guy.

462
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:48,155
Mr. Plane, I'm sorry.

463
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:50,594
I have taken your money.

464
00:29:50,888 --> 00:29:52,163
I will pay it back gradually.

465
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:55,101
Just give me a few days.

466
00:29:55,794 --> 00:30:00,173
What the heck, Rene'?
You think, you're too smart!

467
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:03,208
Did you get taken in by
some uneducated fool'?

468
00:30:04,001 --> 00:30:08,711
Do you think, you'll be safe if you
complain to Mr. Prabhu about me'?

469
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:11,650
The money I have taken from you...

470
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:15,019
...included his cut, too.
Do you get that'?

471
00:30:16,446 --> 00:30:17,892
He complained about me!

472
00:30:18,282 --> 00:30:22,321
H' you do that, again, <i>I'll</i> make
sure you pack up!

473
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:24,798
Who are you threatening?

474
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,798
I know Mr. Prabhu really well.

475
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,604
He isn't like you.

476
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:29,864
Why are you asking me'?

477
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:32,669
I don't have to ask,
we all know you.

478
00:30:33,096 --> 00:30:35,634
Listen, Vijay. I've had
enough of your sass.

479
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:37,972
Just zip it.
- Why should I?

480
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:40,747
Everyone knows you feed off more
on money, than you eat food.

481
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:44,052
What the heck...
- Hey, Gaitonde! Stop!

482
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:47,355
Okay, okay. Let me go.
Let go!

483
00:30:51,915 --> 00:30:53,554
I won't spare you, Vijay.

484
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,826
We will settle up later.

485
00:30:56,653 --> 00:30:58,098
<i>I'll</i> have my day.

486
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:02,462
Every dog has his day.

487
00:31:09,366 --> 00:31:12,347
He came so defiantly, but, he's
leaving like a mouse!

488
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:15,148
Vijay, don't get into
trouble over me.

489
00:31:15,472 --> 00:31:17,076
I will do the job and leave.

490
00:31:17,241 --> 00:31:19,278
He's going to harass you
later for no reason.

491
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:21,685
Vijay, Gaitonde is a cop.

492
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:24,282
He has power.
Don't mess with him.

493
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,759
I didn't mess with him.

494
00:31:25,849 --> 00:31:27,385
And I didn't lie.

495
00:31:27,551 --> 00:31:29,498
Why are we so scared of cops'?

496
00:31:29,653 --> 00:31:31,724
They are meant to serve us
and not the other way around.

497
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:35,833
"When the clouds rain down...

498
00:31:35,926 --> 00:31:38,999
...I look at you to my
hearfs content."

499
00:31:39,096 --> 00:31:45,012
"You are a prayer
for rain, to me."

500
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:47,405
Very good.

501
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:54,949
"Let me stay in your arms...

502
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:58,255
...let me go crazy for you".

503
00:31:58,348 --> 00:32:03,765
"Let me suffer whatever you have
to give me, my love."

504
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:11,671
451.

505
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,704
452.

506
00:32:14,031 --> 00:32:15,203
Jose.
- Hmm.

507
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,611
I've got a headache.
I'm going home. Understood?

508
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,249
Okay.
- He doesn't understand a thing.

509
00:32:20,771 --> 00:32:22,751
H' ifs Sunny Leone,
you're bound to get a headache.

510
00:32:23,173 --> 00:32:24,675
Dr. Joshi...

511
00:32:24,741 --> 00:32:26,550
Rascal! He understands
everything.

512
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:38,626
Sometimes, I wonder.

513
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:43,028
Okay so, who made
you wonder today?

514
00:32:44,828 --> 00:32:45,807
Let's go in, <i>I'll</i> tell you.

515
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:48,207
No, tell me or
I won't let you in.

516
00:32:48,598 --> 00:32:50,339
Come on, you can't do that.
- Tell me.

517
00:32:52,069 --> 00:32:53,309
Sunny Leone? Right'?

518
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:58,375
Jism <i>2</i> or Jackpot?

519
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:00,584
Jackpot.

520
00:33:08,885 --> 00:33:11,332
You're now a dad,
but you still act like a kid.

521
00:33:12,789 --> 00:33:15,134
I'm not a kid.
I'm young.

522
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:32,080
Good morning, dad.
- Good morning.

523
00:33:32,175 --> 00:33:33,347
Good morning.

524
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:39,217
Dad, did you come home,
last night'?

525
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,123
Yes, dear.
- Why?

526
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:43,965
Anu, don't ask nosy questions.

527
00:33:44,388 --> 00:33:48,302
Why? Dad comes home,
very rarely, so I asked.

528
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:50,971
Don't ask too many questions.
Don't you have to go to school?

529
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:52,505
You're not even wearing
your uniforms, yet.

530
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,335
Come on, dad!
How could you forget'?

531
00:33:54,531 --> 00:33:56,671
What?
- It's a holiday, today.

532
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:58,974
Did the school declare
that, or did you do that'?

533
00:33:59,636 --> 00:34:01,913
Our daughters make excuses
expertly.

534
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:04,413
Ifs Sunday tomorrow.
Why do you have a holiday today?

535
00:34:04,674 --> 00:34:06,244
Ifs Gandhi Jayanti today.

536
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:09,083
So'? Go and study.

537
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:11,190
No, dad. I am going to play.

538
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:16,063
These kids...

539
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,061
Won't you bathe, today?

540
00:34:20,557 --> 00:34:22,003
I don't want to.

541
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:24,802
So, who's going to work?

542
00:34:25,695 --> 00:34:26,936
I don't know.

543
00:34:28,532 --> 00:34:30,307
I ran out of stamina yesterday.

544
00:34:33,403 --> 00:34:35,041
I mean, that...

545
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:38,914
...my bike broke down on the way.
So, I had to push it home.

546
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:40,280
I got tired.

547
00:34:40,777 --> 00:34:42,382
Anju.

548
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:46,190
<i>I'll</i> give you a list.
Get some things from the market.

549
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:48,760
Okay. Can I go in the evening,
please?

550
00:34:48,952 --> 00:34:50,728
Alright, but don't forget.

551
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:07,210
Anju. Remember me'?
lfs Sam.

552
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:12,510
Yes, I do. But, what are you
doing here?

553
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:16,286
Me'? I came to meet you.

554
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,382
Me'?
- Hmm.

555
00:35:19,182 --> 00:35:20,092
Why?

556
00:35:23,487 --> 00:35:24,967
Finish it. Okay?
- Hmm.

557
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,168
See who's at the door.
- Okay.

558
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,103
Hi, Anju.

559
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:56,329
Don't worry. I didn't
show this video to anyone.

560
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:59,831
In fact, I'm thinking of
deleting it.

561
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:02,661
You want that, too, right'?

562
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:07,141
Great! Make my wish
come true.

563
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:11,009
Tonight at 11 pm,
behind your house.

564
00:36:11,668 --> 00:36:12,976
You'll meet me, right'?

565
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:15,476
No! I won't come there.

566
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:18,543
I didn't show this video to anyone.
Not even my friends.

567
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:22,219
I didn't forward it or think
of uploading it on the net.

568
00:36:24,014 --> 00:36:27,485
But, just think about it.
What if I do all that'?

569
00:36:28,351 --> 00:36:30,262
What about your 'family's reputation?

570
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:34,094
Sam, please, Sam!

571
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:36,094
Please, delete this video.

572
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:37,797
Why are you hassling me'?
Please!

573
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,467
I will do it.
Tonight at 11 pm.

574
00:36:40,764 --> 00:36:42,141
Behind your house.

575
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,969
Alone .
Alright?

576
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,576
<i>I'll</i> see you.
- No, Sam!

577
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:48,340
<i>I'll</i> see you.
- Sam!

578
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:51,309
Sam, please!
Sam!

579
00:36:52,409 --> 00:36:53,684
Sam!

580
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,367
What is it'?

581
00:37:11,728 --> 00:37:13,503
I've a slight headache.

582
00:37:13,597 --> 00:37:14,838
Do you want some medicine?

583
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:17,478
No. <i>I'll</i> be fine, once I lie
down for a bit.

584
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:19,806
Eat something.
It's almost dinner 'time.

585
00:37:33,483 --> 00:37:36,293
Run! Rum
<i>'</i> No! <i>'</i>

586
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:38,592
Run,

587
00:37:39,356 --> 00:37:40,768
It seems, a storm is coming.

588
00:37:40,824 --> 00:37:42,327
Hey, don't jinx it!

589
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:44,597
I'm leaving.

590
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:47,001
Got an umbrella?
- Yes.

591
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:23,677
Anju, you shouldn't have
done this.

592
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:26,313
I guess, you aren't
taking me seriously.

593
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:30,882
Sam, please!
Don't harass me anymore.

594
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,686
Please, delete the video.
- Should I delete it'?

595
00:38:34,344 --> 00:38:36,382
You cheated me.
- No, Sam.

596
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:37,789
Just you wait.

597
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:40,119
Why are you doing this?

598
00:38:41,184 --> 00:38:42,721
We didn't harm you in any way.

599
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,625
I request you...

600
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:47,664
...don't ruin her life.

601
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,266
Ifs no use, now.

602
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:52,806
She was ruined the day
I shot this video.

603
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:56,204
You've seen it today.

604
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,905
Soon, everyone on the internet
will watch it.

605
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:04,483
They'll know how she bathes.

606
00:39:08,378 --> 00:39:12,155
I request you.
Please delete it.

607
00:39:12,782 --> 00:39:13,920
I won't do that.

608
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:16,824
Don't you have any shame?

609
00:39:18,088 --> 00:39:19,829
Delete it.
- No.

610
00:39:20,724 --> 00:39:22,170
Please, delete it.

611
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:24,135
I told you, I won't do it.

612
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:54,800
I beg you.
Please, delete it.

613
00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:00,775
We'll be ruined!
Please!

614
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:05,737
Alright.

615
00:40:07,036 --> 00:40:09,608
I will delete the video.

616
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:14,152
But, you must give me
what I want.

617
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,253
What'?

618
00:40:34,931 --> 00:40:36,206
Anju.

619
00:40:38,168 --> 00:40:39,512
Nandini!

620
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:42,646
Ahju!

621
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:44,010
An...

622
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:51,023
Dad!

623
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,389
Anju, what happened?

624
00:40:54,751 --> 00:40:56,059
Aniu?

625
00:40:58,255 --> 00:40:59,632
Nandini, what happened?

626
00:41:01,724 --> 00:41:03,329
Why doesn't someone tell me'?

627
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:14,313
I will delete the video.

628
00:41:17,106 --> 00:41:18,847
But, you must give me...

629
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:22,556
...what I want.

630
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:34,001
Or, I will...

631
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,034
...upload this video online.

632
00:42:02,385 --> 00:42:03,626
Ahju!

633
00:42:06,289 --> 00:42:07,563
Ahju!

634
00:42:08,291 --> 00:42:11,534
Anju, he's not breathing!

635
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:16,739
Sam! Sam!

636
00:42:17,534 --> 00:42:18,672
Sam?

637
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:59,014
What happened?
- Mom, I can't get through to dad.

638
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,418
I guess, the line is dead...

639
00:43:02,378 --> 00:43:04,255
Let's go.
Come with me.

640
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:03,711
Anju, get the spade.

641
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:04,643
What will we do, now'?

642
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:06,512
I don't know.

643
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:11,315
I don't know how I got
the courage, to bury him.

644
00:45:13,309 --> 00:45:15,289
But, I'm shaking all over, now.

645
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:19,184
Did I make a mistake
by burying him?

646
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:21,918
No.

647
00:45:22,452 --> 00:45:23,659
You did the right thing.

648
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,666
No... if we had informed the
police at once...

649
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:29,664
...we wouldn't feel scared.

650
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,668
H' we'd gone to the police...

651
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:35,135
...Anju's life
would be ruined.

652
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,072
I'm really scared!

653
00:45:41,804 --> 00:45:45,309
Don't be scared. I won't let
anything happen to you.

654
00:45:46,242 --> 00:45:49,382
See what I found
in the Outhouse.

655
00:45:50,847 --> 00:45:52,293
Did Sam have a car'?

656
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:55,487
Yes, he had a yellow car.

657
00:45:57,221 --> 00:45:59,461
He must have parked it nearby.

658
00:46:00,423 --> 00:46:02,097
Have you checked the
Outhouse, properly?

659
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:04,168
No.
- No.

660
00:46:04,728 --> 00:46:05,865
Let's go.

661
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:18,177
Where did Sam fall when you
hit him'?

662
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:20,251
Right there.

663
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,961
What are you searching for'?

664
00:46:30,853 --> 00:46:33,630
Blood. There's not a single
drop of blood here.

665
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:38,731
When you hit him with the
stick, did you hit his head?

666
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:44,340
Perhaps, ifs an internal
injury.

667
00:46:44,967 --> 00:46:46,811
We have to clean the
Outhouse, thoroughly.

668
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:01,494
Just a moment.

669
00:47:06,956 --> 00:47:07,934
Trace it, quickly!

670
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:09,264
As soon as the SIM card is put in...

671
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:11,168
Trace it 'fast.
- Trace 'the location oi 'the SIM card.

672
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:13,639
Find out where he's travelling.
- We are getting the signal.

673
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:15,141
Ifs really easy to trace his
SIM now.

674
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,472
I've traced it, sir.

675
00:47:16,532 --> 00:47:18,842
He's talking from the second floor.
- And he's travelling to Pune.

676
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:20,813
Sir, if he speaks for five minutes,
we'll have the exact location.

677
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:23,043
The SIM card has been activated.
So, the exact location...

678
00:47:23,139 --> 00:47:24,585
Trace the SIM card.
- Sir, ifs within a half...

679
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,018
...kilometer radius.

680
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:27,782
I guess
he threw the mobile away.

681
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:30,920
Sir, he's traveling via Rajasthan
to Haryana.

682
00:47:44,193 --> 00:47:47,539
Don't leave the house
until I get back.

683
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:49,275
Don't call anyone.

684
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:51,675
Keep the doors and
windows locked.

685
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:55,172
It should appear as if no
one is at home.

686
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,481
Where are you going?

687
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,577
I have to find the car and
take it somewhere else.

688
00:47:59,909 --> 00:48:01,547
Get back, soon.

689
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:08,224
Anju!
- I didn't mean to kill Sam.

690
00:48:08,284 --> 00:48:11,664
I was just trying to
break his phone.

691
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:14,668
But, he didn't let go...
- I know. I know!

692
00:48:15,324 --> 00:48:17,896
I don't want to go to prison!
Please.

693
00:48:17,994 --> 00:48:19,440
Are you crazy?

694
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:21,842
I'm still alive.

695
00:48:22,632 --> 00:48:24,112
I won't let you go to jail.

696
00:48:25,702 --> 00:48:26,737
Nothing will happen to you.

697
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:44,155
Salvi, stop counting and
give all oi that 'to me.

698
00:48:49,458 --> 00:48:52,338
Is that all you've got'?

699
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,500
Sir, isn't Rs. 500 enough?

700
00:48:59,168 --> 00:49:03,173
Ifs not for a driver's license.
This is for passport verification.

701
00:49:03,873 --> 00:49:06,251
You want to go to London
to meet your son, right'?

702
00:49:13,449 --> 00:49:15,657
How much for you?
- Sir, ifs fifty five.

703
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:18,661
Do you think, ifs raining money?
Fifty five, it seems!

704
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:27,139
Here, that's thirty.

705
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:28,865
Get going.

706
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:30,675
Alright, then.

707
00:49:30,867 --> 00:49:32,675
Get me a gift from London.

708
00:49:38,507 --> 00:49:40,215
What the heck?
Who is it'?

709
00:49:49,585 --> 00:49:51,088
Isn't that Vijay Salgaonkar'?

710
00:49:51,153 --> 00:49:52,427
It seems to be.

711
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,230
When did he buy a car'?

712
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:55,831
Where does he live'?

713
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:02,534
His garden is across the road.

714
00:50:23,719 --> 00:50:25,130
Mom.

715
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:31,364
We'll be in big trouble,
because of me. Right'?

716
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:35,135
Don't say that.

717
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:37,643
We are with you.

718
00:50:39,436 --> 00:50:43,407
You don't know,
whose son he was.

719
00:50:44,974 --> 00:50:46,454
Whose son was he'?

720
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:36,532
Listen, I wanted to tell you...

721
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:38,606
...on the next weekend on
the 2nd and 3rd of October...

722
00:51:38,661 --> 00:51:41,666
...Swami Chinmayanand
is holding a sermon at Panaji.

723
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:48,376
Come on, now!

724
00:51:49,572 --> 00:51:51,416
Hey, move it!

725
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:38,496
Yes, sir'?
- Can I buy a phone?

726
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:40,630
A new one?
- No, a used phone.

727
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:41,827
Sure.

728
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:44,461
Please make sure the battery
is fully charged. - Sure.

729
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:48,541
Here you are, sir.

730
00:52:48,731 --> 00:52:50,210
How much for this?
- Rs. 900.

731
00:53:02,144 --> 00:53:04,920
Here you are.
- Could you put the SIM card in'?

732
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:17,096
Here you are, sir.
- Thank you.

733
00:53:22,364 --> 00:53:24,208
How do I reduce the volume?

734
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:25,840
Here.

735
00:53:27,469 --> 00:53:28,914
Ifs done, sir.
- Thank you.

736
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:30,242
You're welcome.

737
00:54:53,722 --> 00:54:57,135
There is a stone quarry, about
15 kms away in Paavelim.

738
00:54:57,293 --> 00:54:58,773
I mean, it used to be there.

739
00:54:58,927 --> 00:55:00,771
We got it shut down,
after protesting against it.

740
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,001
There is a lake right in
the middle of it.

741
00:55:06,268 --> 00:55:08,248
But, the project is
not eco friendly.

742
00:57:24,139 --> 00:57:26,780
Ifs you! I thought, you'd
taken a holiday.

743
00:57:27,242 --> 00:57:28,244
What happened, today?

744
00:57:28,411 --> 00:57:30,288
Nothing much.
I collected the payments.

745
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:33,121
As always, Mrs. Pereira avoided
making the payment.

746
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:35,896
Okay, listen to me.

747
00:57:36,552 --> 00:57:39,726
I am not here for <i>2</i> days.
I am going to Panaji for a sermon.

748
00:57:40,222 --> 00:57:41,827
Sermons?

749
00:57:42,324 --> 00:57:43,827
Nandini really wants to go.

750
00:57:44,793 --> 00:57:46,137
We are leaving, tomorrow.

751
00:57:46,528 --> 00:57:47,701
Take care of things.

752
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,204
Mr. Vijay.

753
00:57:51,867 --> 00:57:53,347
Anything wrong'?

754
00:57:55,237 --> 00:57:56,181
Not at all.
Why?

755
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:59,186
Well, you just seem slightly
'off. That's all.

756
00:58:01,844 --> 00:58:03,414
Not at all!

757
00:58:03,612 --> 00:58:06,025
But, if I find out, that
you've messed up...

758
00:58:06,315 --> 00:58:07,385
...I'll rub you out!

759
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:08,789
Now, that's more like you.

760
00:58:08,885 --> 00:58:11,262
Get lost. Don't screen too many
adult films.

761
00:58:12,054 --> 00:58:13,500
Sure.

762
00:58:40,282 --> 00:58:41,626
Who is it'?

763
00:58:41,717 --> 00:58:43,061
Ifs Vii-EV-

764
00:58:54,898 --> 00:58:55,932
Don't cry, dear.

765
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:57,543
I'm back.

766
00:58:58,635 --> 00:59:02,014
Dad, don't ever leave me again.

767
00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:03,411
I won't.

768
00:59:03,907 --> 00:59:05,146
Vi] 8y -

769
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:07,717
Sam was 'the son oi 'the
IG oi Goa.

770
00:59:09,112 --> 00:59:10,954
Inspector General of Police.

771
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,159
You're lying!

772
00:59:19,588 --> 00:59:20,760
Tell me!

773
00:59:26,228 --> 00:59:27,606
<i>Patâ€œ!</i>

774
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:52,958
Senior Inspector D'souza.

775
00:59:53,523 --> 00:59:55,230
And Inspector Mohite.

776
00:59:56,826 --> 00:59:59,329
These are the name of
the suspended officers.

777
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:03,373
Because of whom'?

778
01:00:06,135 --> 01:00:08,672
The court warned the
police department.

779
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:12,175
They may set up an enquiry, too.

780
01:00:13,208 --> 01:00:14,552
Because of whom'?

781
01:00:16,378 --> 01:00:19,291
The murderer in this case is
roaming soot free.

782
01:00:20,817 --> 01:00:21,954
Because of whom'?

783
01:00:23,452 --> 01:00:26,059
Because, both of you
testified in court...

784
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:29,369
...that, the police forced you
to make a statement.

785
01:00:32,862 --> 01:00:35,775
Do you think, the police department
is a joke?

786
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:39,739
And you can do anything
you want'?

787
01:00:45,907 --> 01:00:47,909
I want you to give another
statement.

788
01:00:49,311 --> 01:00:50,688
This time, make it the truth.

789
01:00:51,146 --> 01:00:52,217
No, ma'am.

790
01:00:52,715 --> 01:00:54,284
Ma'am, they will kill us.

791
01:00:54,684 --> 01:00:57,130
They will kill you and so
you won't testify.

792
01:00:58,253 --> 01:01:00,961
And so, both my officers
will stay under suspension.

793
01:01:04,059 --> 01:01:05,300
Patil.
- Yes, Madam.

794
01:01:06,461 --> 01:01:08,771
Did anyone see you
when you fetched them'?

795
01:01:09,331 --> 01:01:10,811
No, Madam. We were in civil
clothes.

796
01:01:15,938 --> 01:01:17,177
Alright, then.

797
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:20,911
String them both up
with a noose around their necks.

798
01:01:22,277 --> 01:01:25,088
Anchor them with a heavy stone
and toss them into the sea.

799
01:01:25,914 --> 01:01:28,327
No one will know.
The corpses won't be found.

800
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:32,126
I won't waste my time on them.

801
01:01:35,123 --> 01:01:37,001
No, ma'am!

802
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:39,097
Ma'am. We'll tell the truth.

803
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:40,704
Ma'am, they are innocent.

804
01:01:40,929 --> 01:01:42,465
We will tell the truth.

805
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:47,105
Patil, when they come to
testify in the court...

806
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:48,672
...bring in their families.

807
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:49,972
Okay, Madam.

808
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:53,577
It they give a false testimony,
maim their families.

809
01:01:54,443 --> 01:01:55,717
I don't care.

810
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:36,490
Why are you smiling?

811
01:02:36,918 --> 01:02:39,023
Aren't you tensed?
- About what'?

812
01:02:39,454 --> 01:02:40,797
That boy...

813
01:02:41,023 --> 01:02:42,228
Which boy?

814
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:44,898
Sam.
- Who's Sam?

815
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:47,431
The one who...
- Just a moment.

816
01:02:49,465 --> 01:02:51,411
I don't know anyone called Sam.

817
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:54,012
And no boy entered this house.

818
01:02:55,103 --> 01:02:57,311
From now on, we are
going to react just like that.

819
01:02:57,373 --> 01:02:58,784
As if nothing happened.

820
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:02,815
Or the fear and tension
may cause problems for us.

821
01:03:04,213 --> 01:03:07,682
I just realized that
a while back.

822
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:09,925
Before I arrived home,
I went to the office.

823
01:03:10,318 --> 01:03:12,731
Jose asked me
if anything was wrong.

824
01:03:14,257 --> 01:03:17,965
H' Jose can figure out something
is wrong in a few moments...

825
01:03:18,927 --> 01:03:20,929
...then, others can
figure it out, too.

826
01:03:22,398 --> 01:03:25,606
But, when I answered him as
I normally do, he was assured.

827
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:29,677
So, forget what happened.

828
01:03:30,172 --> 01:03:32,813
Behave as if nothing
has happened.

829
01:03:33,242 --> 01:03:34,346
Everything is normal.

830
01:03:34,876 --> 01:03:38,153
What did you do about the car'?

831
01:03:38,213 --> 01:03:40,523
I won't tell you stuff...

832
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:42,820
mthat you don't need to
know about.

833
01:03:42,885 --> 01:03:44,762
Don't even try to find out.

834
01:03:47,889 --> 01:03:49,130
Pack your bags.

835
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:51,237
We leave tomorrow morning.

836
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:53,101
Where to'?

837
01:03:53,161 --> 01:03:54,971
We have to stay somewhere
else for two days.

838
01:03:56,164 --> 01:03:58,974
It'll be a good change
and help us relax.

839
01:04:00,268 --> 01:04:02,771
H' anyone asks you
where we're going, tell them...

840
01:04:03,472 --> 01:04:06,112
...we are going to attend
Swami Chinmayanands sermon.

841
01:04:06,708 --> 01:04:08,780
But, that got over today.

842
01:04:30,498 --> 01:04:31,842
Hello!
- Hi, Mahesh.

843
01:04:32,134 --> 01:04:35,512
Are you going back or...
- Yes, <i>I'll</i> freshen up and go back.

844
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,514
Meera, did you speak to Sam?

845
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:41,117
I've been trying to call since last
night. His phone is switched off.

846
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:44,585
You call him constantly
and bother him, Mahesh.

847
01:04:44,679 --> 01:04:47,217
So, he must have switched it off
on purpose.

848
01:04:47,315 --> 01:04:49,922
That's nice. You're scolding
me for all my trouble.

849
01:04:50,585 --> 01:04:52,963
You've allowed him to take
too many liberties.

850
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:57,068
Mahesh, kids want freedom
at this age.

851
01:04:57,126 --> 01:04:58,798
We must give it to them.

852
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,907
Freedom? How much
freedom does he want'?

853
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:03,402
We have given him everything.

854
01:05:03,465 --> 01:05:05,742
A phone, laptop, <i>2</i> credit cards,
a car.

855
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:07,074
Why does he need all that'?

856
01:05:07,469 --> 01:05:11,007
Have you seen last month's
credit card bill'? Rs. 60,000.

857
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,851
Yes, that's because, he bought
a new laptop.

858
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:15,612
And I've seen the receipt.

859
01:05:15,677 --> 01:05:17,213
Why does he need another
laptop?

860
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:19,483
How does the receipt matter?
Did you see the laptop?

861
01:05:19,547 --> 01:05:20,856
I haven't seen it.

862
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:23,494
Mahesh, stop doubting your
son so much.

863
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:25,661
He'll run away forever,
some day.

864
01:05:26,054 --> 01:05:28,262
I don't doubt him.
I worry about him, Meera.

865
01:05:28,490 --> 01:05:30,766
You're pampered him
to such an extent that...

866
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,762
Sorry. I'm getting late.
Okay?

867
01:05:34,329 --> 01:05:37,311
H' you speak to him,
tell him to come home. Okay?

868
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:39,101
Bye Meera.
- Bye.

869
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:53,422
Alright, tickets, please.

870
01:05:53,516 --> 01:05:55,018
Mr. Salgaonkar!

871
01:05:55,083 --> 01:05:57,155
Are you going on a trip
with the family?

872
01:05:58,054 --> 01:05:59,396
Did you buy a new bus?

873
01:05:59,621 --> 01:06:01,965
No, it's a used bus.
- It's nice.

874
01:06:02,057 --> 01:06:03,559
Where are you off to'?

875
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:06,766
We are going to attend our
spiritual guru's sermon at Panaji.

876
01:06:07,262 --> 01:06:10,106
Give me four tickets.
- What's wrong with you?

877
01:06:10,766 --> 01:06:13,576
I can't let you pay tor
tickets on my bus.

878
01:06:13,969 --> 01:06:15,847
Put it away.
- Thank you.

879
01:06:15,905 --> 01:06:18,282
Alright, tickets, please!

880
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:19,978
Tickets!

881
01:06:22,978 --> 01:06:27,724
"Dying every moment.

882
01:06:29,918 --> 01:06:34,561
"...living for the moment."

883
01:06:37,025 --> 01:06:42,338
"Barely alive..."

884
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:49,811
" It's stifling . . . "

885
01:06:52,942 --> 01:06:59,052
" It's stifling . . . "

886
01:06:59,148 --> 01:07:02,219
"I'm in pain."

887
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:08,291
" It's stifling . . . "

888
01:07:08,391 --> 01:07:11,599
"Fear picks at my mind."

889
01:07:11,659 --> 01:07:17,804
" It's stifling . . . "

890
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:23,815
"Dying every moment,
living for the moment."

891
01:07:24,106 --> 01:07:25,710
"Barely alive..."

892
01:07:25,775 --> 01:07:31,817
" It's stifling . . . "

893
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:37,853
" It's stifling . . . "

894
01:07:50,632 --> 01:07:56,344
" It's stifling . . . "

895
01:07:56,438 --> 01:08:03,652
"My lips ravaged,
I can barely speak."

896
01:08:05,713 --> 01:08:12,961
"Bloodless limbs,
my body is drifting aimlessly."

897
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:21,738
"The tears
caught up in my heart..."

898
01:08:21,796 --> 01:08:23,400
"...my eyes glaze over with tears."

899
01:08:23,466 --> 01:08:29,472
" It's stifling . . . "

900
01:08:29,537 --> 01:08:35,681
" It's stifling . . . "

901
01:08:45,186 --> 01:08:51,034
" It's stifling . . . "

902
01:08:51,092 --> 01:08:58,671
"Why do I feel someone
watching me from a distance?"

903
01:09:00,402 --> 01:09:04,350
"Did anyone come near me?"

904
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:11,514
"Does my shadow follow me?"

905
01:09:13,215 --> 01:09:20,860
"But, my heart beat is
subdued."

906
01:09:20,922 --> 01:09:22,698
"Barely breathing..."

907
01:09:22,757 --> 01:09:28,400
" It's stifling . . . "

908
01:09:28,796 --> 01:09:34,747
" It's stifling . . . "

909
01:09:35,003 --> 01:09:38,109
"My breath catches
ever so slightly."

910
01:09:38,173 --> 01:09:44,090
" It's stifling . . . "

911
01:09:44,345 --> 01:09:47,384
"Why is every
moment stifling me?"

912
01:09:47,483 --> 01:09:53,627
" It's stifling . . . "

913
01:09:53,721 --> 01:09:56,895
" It's stifling . . . "

914
01:09:59,627 --> 01:10:01,163
What did I say to you?

915
01:10:01,596 --> 01:10:03,507
I know, but I can't seem to forget.

916
01:10:03,832 --> 01:10:05,333
You have to forget.

917
01:10:05,935 --> 01:10:09,041
Our fear is the one last piece
of evidence of what happened.

918
01:10:09,771 --> 01:10:11,274
We have to get rid ot that
as well.

919
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:13,313
And there's just one
more thing.

920
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:16,515
Get a bill for everything
you buy, from now on.

921
01:10:16,979 --> 01:10:19,015
Groceries, vegetables,
fruits, pencils.

922
01:10:19,081 --> 01:10:20,423
Get bills tor the
most trivial things.

923
01:10:20,515 --> 01:10:27,957
"It is stifling..."

924
01:10:28,056 --> 01:10:31,095
"It is stifling..."

925
01:10:31,193 --> 01:10:34,230
"My breath catches
ever so slightly."

926
01:10:34,296 --> 01:10:40,439
"It is stifling..."

927
01:10:40,502 --> 01:10:43,539
"Why is every
moment stifling me?"

928
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:47,814
"It is stifling..."

929
01:10:47,876 --> 01:10:49,855
Let me speak to Kanvinde from
the cyber cell.

930
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:55,260
"It is stifling..."

931
01:11:48,936 --> 01:11:53,545
"Dying every moment.

932
01:11:55,911 --> 01:12:01,155
"...living for the moment."

933
01:12:03,085 --> 01:12:07,726
"Barely alive..."

934
01:12:09,591 --> 01:12:15,769
"It is stifling..."

935
01:12:18,934 --> 01:12:25,043
"It is stifling..."

936
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:28,212
"I'm in pain."

937
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:34,317
"It is stifling..."

938
01:12:34,382 --> 01:12:37,556
"Fear picks at my mind."

939
01:12:37,653 --> 01:12:43,864
"It is stifling..."

940
01:12:43,926 --> 01:12:49,841
"Dying every moment,
living for the moment."

941
01:12:50,599 --> 01:12:54,171
Ma'am, we followed Sam's network
from Goa, Hublidarbar, Chittadurg...

942
01:12:54,269 --> 01:12:58,149
...Bengaluru, to Tamil Nadu
and we lost trace in Kanchipuram.

943
01:12:58,506 --> 01:13:00,645
After that, his phone was
switched off.

944
01:13:02,644 --> 01:13:05,750
He has friends in Bengaluru
and Chennai.

945
01:13:06,014 --> 01:13:07,425
Yes, perhaps, he went there.

946
01:13:07,515 --> 01:13:10,655
But, why did the phone get switched
off in Kanchipuram'?

947
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:16,225
"It is stifling..."

948
01:13:16,291 --> 01:13:23,731
"Why do I feel someone
watching me from a distance?"

949
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:30,310
"Did anyone come near me?"

950
01:13:31,806 --> 01:13:36,551
"Does my shadow follow me?"

951
01:13:38,479 --> 01:13:46,057
"But, my heart beat is
subdued."

952
01:13:46,154 --> 01:13:47,792
"Barely breathing..."

953
01:13:47,855 --> 01:13:53,806
" It's stifling . . . "

954
01:13:54,029 --> 01:13:59,944
" It's stifling . . . "

955
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:06,447
"It is stifling..."

956
01:14:06,507 --> 01:14:12,355
"It is stifling..."

957
01:14:12,713 --> 01:14:17,390
"It is stifling..."

958
01:14:49,917 --> 01:14:51,090
ACP Rego.

959
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:52,631
Yes, ma'am.

960
01:14:53,421 --> 01:14:55,095
Ma'am, we just found
the car here.

961
01:14:55,189 --> 01:14:56,692
Who saw it, first'?

962
01:14:56,757 --> 01:14:59,238
A few kids who were swimming
here, found it.

963
01:15:02,663 --> 01:15:04,574
How many days, do you reckon?

964
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:07,645
Ifs been about <i>2</i> weeks.

965
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:11,649
Excuse me, did you find anything
in the lake?

966
01:15:11,707 --> 01:15:13,708
No, sir. Don't worry.

967
01:15:14,475 --> 01:15:16,682
When the car was dumped,
it was empty.

968
01:15:18,479 --> 01:15:21,426
Don't let this
get to the media.

969
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:24,019
Wrap it UP-

970
01:15:26,787 --> 01:15:28,734
The last call from Sam's mobile...

971
01:15:28,789 --> 01:15:31,862
...was made on 2nd October
at 07:12 pm.

972
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:35,432
The signal indicates, that it was
located in Pondolem.

973
01:15:35,730 --> 01:15:38,769
His phone went out of
coverage at 10:30 pm.

974
01:15:39,467 --> 01:15:40,742
The next morning...

975
01:15:40,801 --> 01:15:44,375
...his phone was switched on
once again at Panaji at 9:25 am.

976
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:47,184
After that, the phone
went to Kanchipuram.

977
01:15:47,275 --> 01:15:49,278
Where it was switched off.

978
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:53,658
Ma'am, given the information
we have so far, I think...

979
01:15:54,015 --> 01:15:56,859
...we should confine our
investigation to Goa.

980
01:15:57,185 --> 01:15:58,561
For the time being.

981
01:15:59,688 --> 01:16:04,068
Sam spoke to someone for
the last time on 2nd October.

982
01:16:04,359 --> 01:16:06,600
Get me the details tor that number.
- Yes, ma'am.

983
01:16:08,329 --> 01:16:10,810
Yes? Send him in.

984
01:16:17,805 --> 01:16:19,877
Ma'am, the account number
you gave us...

985
01:16:19,975 --> 01:16:22,682
...was accessed at 10:00 am
on 2nd October...

986
01:16:22,778 --> 01:16:25,257
...at a cash ATM in Panaji.

987
01:16:25,346 --> 01:16:27,020
There is no transaction
after that.

988
01:16:28,015 --> 01:16:29,154
How much cash was withdrawn'?

989
01:16:29,216 --> 01:16:31,662
Rs. 20,000, sir.
- Rs. 20,000'?

990
01:16:33,387 --> 01:16:35,197
Why did he need so much money?

991
01:16:35,457 --> 01:16:36,935
Sir, there's more.

992
01:16:37,225 --> 01:16:40,296
The phone which went out of
range on 2nd October...

993
01:16:40,395 --> 01:16:43,569
...and the one which was switched
on, the morning of 3rd October...

994
01:16:43,832 --> 01:16:45,640
mare two different phones.

995
01:16:46,734 --> 01:16:48,975
The IMEI numbers are different.

996
01:16:49,404 --> 01:16:54,944
Ma'am, possibly he withdrew
cash to buy a new cell phone.

997
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:58,056
I don't think so.

998
01:16:58,145 --> 01:17:01,422
He bought a new cell phone
just two months ago.

999
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:05,162
I think, our son is in
big trouble.

1000
01:17:10,692 --> 01:17:11,500
Sir.

1001
01:17:16,765 --> 01:17:18,801
Hey, you.
What's this?

1002
01:17:21,403 --> 01:17:23,109
The Panchayat building tax.

1003
01:17:23,171 --> 01:17:24,945
I told you to pay that, right'?

1004
01:17:26,007 --> 01:17:28,613
When did I tell you?
- It was...

1005
01:17:28,676 --> 01:17:31,247
Three weeks ago.
- Three weeks?

1006
01:17:31,546 --> 01:17:35,391
Sameer Deshmukh, the only son of
IG Meera Deshmukh.

1007
01:17:35,850 --> 01:17:37,353
He's been missing since
3 weeks.

1008
01:17:38,086 --> 01:17:41,590
According to the phone records,
he was in Pondolem on 2nd October.

1009
01:17:43,725 --> 01:17:46,604
This is the car, he drove in
here.

1010
01:17:47,261 --> 01:17:51,641
A yellow Hyundai Getz,
GA07, MJ 1011.

1011
01:17:58,105 --> 01:18:00,814
This car was recovered from
the lake at Paavelim Stone Quarry.

1012
01:18:01,009 --> 01:18:02,681
But, there is no sign of Sameer.

1013
01:18:23,998 --> 01:18:26,979
H' you are facing a problem,
come to me and...

1014
01:18:29,604 --> 01:18:30,775
What's up, Digambar?

1015
01:18:31,172 --> 01:18:33,015
How is your son, now'?
- He's fine, sir.

1016
01:18:33,108 --> 01:18:34,814
He will be discharged
within a day or two.

1017
01:18:34,876 --> 01:18:36,149
That's good.

1018
01:18:36,211 --> 01:18:37,417
Give me Rs. 200.

1019
01:18:37,511 --> 01:18:38,819
I don't have any money.

1020
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,086
What do you mean, you
don't have money?

1021
01:18:40,181 --> 01:18:42,389
The hospital isn't treating
your son free oi charge.

1022
01:18:42,484 --> 01:18:43,724
No, no...
- Come on, outwith it.

1023
01:18:43,819 --> 01:18:45,389
What's in that pocket?
- It's nothing.

1024
01:18:45,487 --> 01:18:47,125
Let's see it!
Is that all'?

1025
01:18:47,956 --> 01:18:49,867
Fifty rupees?
Get going.

1026
01:18:54,095 --> 01:18:56,006
Martin, give me a packet
of Pan Masala.

1027
01:18:56,497 --> 01:18:58,408
What'? The Pan masala'?

1028
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,273
No tea for you today, Mr. Gaitonde'?

1029
01:19:00,668 --> 01:19:03,479
No, I don't have time for tea.

1030
01:19:04,038 --> 01:19:06,314
I've been assigned
to a major case.

1031
01:19:06,975 --> 01:19:08,113
What is it about'?

1032
01:19:08,176 --> 01:19:10,782
A yellow Hyundai Getz car...

1033
01:19:11,212 --> 01:19:13,591
...was recovered from the lake in
Paavelim stone quarry.

1034
01:19:22,189 --> 01:19:25,033
That's in Paavelim, right'?
Why do you have to get involved?

1035
01:19:25,393 --> 01:19:27,565
Ifs true but, I can't help it.

1036
01:19:27,962 --> 01:19:30,068
The lGfls office called, directly.

1037
01:19:30,564 --> 01:19:33,306
The car belongs 'to
'the son oi 'the IG, you see.

1038
01:19:34,235 --> 01:19:37,182
The IG will obviously employ
the entire police force to work.

1039
01:19:38,672 --> 01:19:41,118
Mr. Sawant and I are working
on this case together.

1040
01:19:41,342 --> 01:19:42,685
<i>I'll</i> leave, now.

1041
01:19:43,011 --> 01:19:44,216
What do you care'?

1042
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:50,826
Mr. Sawant.

1043
01:20:00,395 --> 01:20:03,341
What's wrong'? Everything okay?
- Yes, of course.

1044
01:20:03,430 --> 01:20:05,411
Gaitonde, don't shoot your
mouth off.

1045
01:20:05,766 --> 01:20:08,805
Don't drag Vijay into this, just
because you have issues with him.

1046
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:13,042
I saw him getting into the car.
lfs just...

1047
01:20:18,212 --> 01:20:19,658
That's not all.

1048
01:20:19,847 --> 01:20:23,488
A little while ago, I mentioned the car.
He was disturbed.

1049
01:20:23,984 --> 01:20:25,190
You'll see...

1050
01:20:25,420 --> 01:20:28,697
...even if he is slightly
apprehensive, he will look back.

1051
01:20:39,667 --> 01:20:41,011
He's going to turn, now.

1052
01:20:55,382 --> 01:20:56,690
So, now what'?

1053
01:20:58,752 --> 01:21:00,390
You've lost it, Gaitonde.

1054
01:21:03,992 --> 01:21:07,097
Vijay Salgaonkar and the lGfls
son, Sameer Deshmukh...

1055
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:08,529
What's the connection?

1056
01:21:08,596 --> 01:21:11,475
Sir, Gaitonde and Vijay
can't stand each other.

1057
01:21:11,733 --> 01:21:14,440
That's why, Gaitonde is trying
to implicate Vijay.

1058
01:21:14,636 --> 01:21:17,115
Or he is mistaken.

1059
01:21:18,974 --> 01:21:19,975
Sir.

1060
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:24,689
Sir, on the 3rd of this month
at 7:15 am...

1061
01:21:24,979 --> 01:21:27,859
...I went to Subhash Salvis place
for passport verification.

1062
01:21:29,417 --> 01:21:31,828
I saw Vijay Salgaonkar there.

1063
01:21:33,354 --> 01:21:35,028
I am absolutely sure.

1064
01:21:35,856 --> 01:21:38,497
Where were you on the afternoon of
the 2nd of this month'?

1065
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:41,305
We went for a sermon to Panaji.

1066
01:21:41,896 --> 01:21:44,604
When did you get back?
- The next day, on a Sunday.

1067
01:21:44,765 --> 01:21:47,837
At what time'?
- In the evening.

1068
01:21:48,168 --> 01:21:50,171
Where was the sermon held?
- In Panaji.

1069
01:21:50,404 --> 01:21:51,645
Where, in Panaji'?

1070
01:21:54,009 --> 01:21:55,351
Patio...

1071
01:21:57,578 --> 01:21:58,682
In Patio colony.

1072
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:02,024
Really? Was it in Patio colony?

1073
01:22:04,685 --> 01:22:07,222
The hermitage is there.
That's where the sermon was held.

1074
01:22:07,521 --> 01:22:09,126
Vijay, what's going on?

1075
01:22:10,024 --> 01:22:11,628
Will the police
actually come here?

1076
01:22:11,826 --> 01:22:12,930
Absolutely.

1077
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:15,006
We don't know when
they will come.

1078
01:22:15,497 --> 01:22:16,942
But, they will certainly come over.

1079
01:22:17,431 --> 01:22:19,469
But, you don't have to worry.

1080
01:22:19,801 --> 01:22:22,509
The police has no clues
about Sam.

1081
01:22:23,137 --> 01:22:24,640
And, they don't have any evidence
either.

1082
01:22:24,972 --> 01:22:29,046
But, they will try to
gather evidence.

1083
01:22:29,711 --> 01:22:32,418
So, they will cross question you.

1084
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:36,860
Either they will ask nicely
or they will scare you.

1085
01:22:37,217 --> 01:22:41,222
Your mom and I may be
beaten up, before you.

1086
01:22:42,756 --> 01:22:46,796
But, if they don't get the answers
they want, they'll let us go.

1087
01:22:48,195 --> 01:22:50,971
So no matter what happens...
anything at all...

1088
01:22:52,766 --> 01:22:55,077
...you can't change your statement
under any circumstances.

1089
01:22:55,837 --> 01:22:57,475
Just stick to your story.

1090
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,649
Can you both do that'?

1091
01:23:01,943 --> 01:23:05,981
Dad, will they beat you
and mom up very badly?

1092
01:23:07,181 --> 01:23:08,752
Don't think about that.

1093
01:23:09,751 --> 01:23:12,493
When you are naughty,
I hit you too, right'?

1094
01:23:12,787 --> 01:23:14,027
That's about it.

1095
01:23:15,356 --> 01:23:16,631
Don't be scared.

1096
01:23:17,292 --> 01:23:19,271
Ifs late.
Go to bed.

1097
01:23:19,694 --> 01:23:21,640
Good night.
- Good night.

1098
01:23:27,435 --> 01:23:31,610
Vijay, how are we going to prove
we weren't here on Saturday?

1099
01:23:32,039 --> 01:23:35,487
Someone must have seen you at
the office or at Martin's corner.

1100
01:23:39,247 --> 01:23:41,556
Of course, they must have.
- Then what'?

1101
01:23:41,649 --> 01:23:43,855
Nandini, what happened to us...

1102
01:23:44,752 --> 01:23:47,096
...has left us with only
two options.

1103
01:23:48,523 --> 01:23:50,365
Either we give in...

1104
01:23:51,091 --> 01:23:52,729
...or we stand up and fight.

1105
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:56,001
I don't think, we've done
anything wrong.

1106
01:23:56,930 --> 01:23:59,240
So, there's no way
I'm going to give in.

1107
01:24:00,167 --> 01:24:01,805
We will fight.

1108
01:24:02,069 --> 01:24:03,845
Now, this is a game.

1109
01:24:05,172 --> 01:24:08,518
We may win, or we may lose.

1110
01:24:10,145 --> 01:24:12,351
But, I can guarantee one thing.

1111
01:24:14,515 --> 01:24:15,994
No matter what happens...

1112
01:24:16,850 --> 01:24:19,457
...you or the kids won't
go to prison.

1113
01:24:23,123 --> 01:24:26,400
I can't say for sure,
that it was Vijay Salgaonkar.

1114
01:24:26,461 --> 01:24:27,734
Really?

1115
01:24:29,029 --> 01:24:30,975
You said, it was Vijay.

1116
01:24:31,065 --> 01:24:34,342
No, when you asked, is that
Vijay...

1117
01:24:34,435 --> 01:24:36,313
...I thought, it was probably him.

1118
01:24:36,371 --> 01:24:38,680
But, I can't say for sure
it was him.

1119
01:24:38,773 --> 01:24:40,115
Who did you see?

1120
01:24:40,307 --> 01:24:42,652
Sir, I couldn't see too clearly.

1121
01:24:42,710 --> 01:24:44,882
I can't tell if it was Vijay
or someone else.

1122
01:24:44,979 --> 01:24:47,515
When he mentioned Vijay,
I had a doubt.

1123
01:24:48,015 --> 01:24:49,722
Was that the car'?

1124
01:24:50,051 --> 01:24:54,193
It was yellow, like this car.
But, I can't say for sure.

1125
01:24:54,255 --> 01:24:57,064
Salvi, there must be something...

1126
01:24:57,125 --> 01:24:59,730
mthat you can be sure ofl?
- Gaitonde!

1127
01:25:01,662 --> 01:25:02,801
YOU?

1128
01:25:03,264 --> 01:25:05,608
Sir, I didn't see the
license number.

1129
01:25:05,667 --> 01:25:07,613
But, it was yellow
like this one.

1130
01:25:08,235 --> 01:25:10,113
There are many yellow
cars, like this one.

1131
01:25:10,337 --> 01:25:13,478
Sir, a retired professor
lives next door.

1132
01:25:13,774 --> 01:25:15,481
He has the same kind of
yellow car.

1133
01:25:15,542 --> 01:25:17,488
Oh, then it could be that car.

1134
01:25:17,545 --> 01:25:21,755
What'? You could say that
for sure'?

1135
01:25:22,817 --> 01:25:24,353
He thinks he's so intelligent!

1136
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:30,534
Sir, a fax from the IG office.

1137
01:25:30,591 --> 01:25:33,300
Sir, Sameer Deshmukh went on
a school trip, the last month.

1138
01:25:33,394 --> 01:25:36,238
Two students from Vidya Vikas
Vidyalaya were there, too.

1139
01:25:36,430 --> 01:25:38,001
I have their names
and addresses.

1140
01:25:38,565 --> 01:25:40,306
One of them is Anju Salgaonkar.

1141
01:25:41,101 --> 01:25:42,774
Vijay Salgaonkafs daughter.

1142
01:25:43,604 --> 01:25:44,777
Adopted.

1143
01:25:46,274 --> 01:25:47,810
Adopted?
- Yeah.

1144
01:25:49,176 --> 01:25:50,622
I didn't know that.

1145
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:54,688
Yes, sir. When Vijay was 21
years old...

1146
01:25:54,748 --> 01:25:58,195
...he found a baby near a
garbage bin on the road.

1147
01:25:59,020 --> 01:26:01,863
Someone had abandoned
that little baby.

1148
01:26:02,789 --> 01:26:04,770
Vijay is an orphan himself.

1149
01:26:04,893 --> 01:26:07,430
That's why, he took the
child home.

1150
01:26:07,795 --> 01:26:10,297
Later, he adopted her legally.

1151
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:15,939
I always thought Anju and
Vijay were related by blood.

1152
01:26:17,604 --> 01:26:18,948
What is this, Gaitonde'?

1153
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:22,548
Shame on you for accusing such
a decent man.

1154
01:26:23,110 --> 01:26:25,488
Sir, sir!

1155
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:28,689
Just because he adopted an
orphan, it doesn't mean...

1156
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:30,387
mthat, he can't commit crimes.

1157
01:26:30,451 --> 01:26:31,895
We just found out...

1158
01:26:31,953 --> 01:26:34,627
...Sameer and Anju
are connected in some way.

1159
01:26:35,523 --> 01:26:37,935
I think, we should arrest Vijay...

1160
01:26:37,992 --> 01:26:40,597
...slap him around a bit
and he'll spill the beans.

1161
01:26:41,628 --> 01:26:44,576
Don't let this information
leak out ot this station.

1162
01:26:45,132 --> 01:26:47,443
Ifs...
- 11:30 am.

1163
01:26:48,336 --> 01:26:52,876
A square plus B square equals
A square, plus B square, plus 2AB.

1164
01:26:53,173 --> 01:26:55,551
A plus B whole cube equals
to...

1165
01:26:55,643 --> 01:26:57,280
...a cube, plus...
- Ma'am.

1166
01:27:00,081 --> 01:27:03,220
Anju. The principal
wants to see you.

1167
01:27:03,618 --> 01:27:05,096
Yes, ma'am.

1168
01:27:15,829 --> 01:27:19,333
The police has one last piece of
evidence to prove what happened.

1169
01:27:19,833 --> 01:27:21,244
Our fear.

1170
01:27:21,301 --> 01:27:23,372
So, forget what happened.

1171
01:27:23,805 --> 01:27:25,648
Try to behave normally.

1172
01:27:26,039 --> 01:27:28,815
The police do not know
what happened in this house.

1173
01:27:28,976 --> 01:27:32,583
They will question us on the
basis of circumstantial evidence.

1174
01:27:33,146 --> 01:27:36,025
We have to answer them
without any fear.

1175
01:27:38,286 --> 01:27:40,390
They will fake things, too.

1176
01:27:40,454 --> 01:27:42,560
But, you knew Sam.

1177
01:27:43,024 --> 01:27:45,128
Don't ever refuse to accept
that.

1178
01:27:45,525 --> 01:27:48,564
Just don't tell them anything
that happened in this house.

1179
01:27:49,863 --> 01:27:50,934
May I come in, ma'am'?

1180
01:27:51,599 --> 01:27:53,771
Are you Vijay
Salgaonkafs daughter?

1181
01:27:53,935 --> 01:27:55,106
Yes, sir.

1182
01:27:56,136 --> 01:27:57,615
Do you know this boy?

1183
01:27:57,671 --> 01:27:59,548
Oh, that's Sam.

1184
01:28:00,841 --> 01:28:03,345
So, how do you know Sam?

1185
01:28:03,645 --> 01:28:07,057
I represented my school at a
nature camp, last month.

1186
01:28:07,247 --> 01:28:09,023
That's when I got to know him.

1187
01:28:09,082 --> 01:28:11,494
Was it just an acquaintance,
or...

1188
01:28:11,886 --> 01:28:13,922
No, sir. Just an acquaintance.

1189
01:28:14,021 --> 01:28:16,935
Just like all the other students
at the camp.

1190
01:28:17,024 --> 01:28:19,231
There were 'thousands oi students
at the camp,

1191
01:28:19,327 --> 01:28:21,829
how come you remember
Sam's face'?

1192
01:28:21,929 --> 01:28:25,740
Sir, Sam was quite famous
at the camp.

1193
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:27,336
Why?

1194
01:28:27,435 --> 01:28:29,471
He took pictures
of girls at the camp.

1195
01:28:29,770 --> 01:28:31,045
He shot videos, too.

1196
01:28:31,238 --> 01:28:34,550
Then, a lawyer's daughter
complained about him.

1197
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:36,645
Oh, I see.

1198
01:28:37,377 --> 01:28:40,221
Did Sam ever come to meet you
after the camp?

1199
01:28:40,747 --> 01:28:42,728
No, sir.
- Why are you lying?

1200
01:28:42,817 --> 01:28:45,262
We were told, he came to
meet you.

1201
01:28:45,653 --> 01:28:48,224
Who told you that'?
Did Sam tell you?

1202
01:28:49,556 --> 01:28:51,729
Yes, he did.

1203
01:28:52,225 --> 01:28:53,569
Sam told us.

1204
01:28:53,627 --> 01:28:55,403
Sir, Sam is lying.

1205
01:28:55,462 --> 01:28:57,271
Did Sam come to meet you...

1206
01:28:57,332 --> 01:29:00,176
...on the 2nd of October
at your place?

1207
01:29:00,268 --> 01:29:01,645
To my place?
- Yes.

1208
01:29:01,735 --> 01:29:02,873
Not at all.

1209
01:29:02,936 --> 01:29:05,712
Besides, we weren't home
on the 2nd of October.

1210
01:29:05,773 --> 01:29:07,046
Where did you go?

1211
01:29:07,108 --> 01:29:09,815
Swami Chinmayanand was holding a
sermon at Panaji.

1212
01:29:09,877 --> 01:29:11,082
We all attended it.

1213
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:12,385
Who all attended it'?

1214
01:29:12,479 --> 01:29:15,518
Mom, dad, my younger
sister Anu and me.

1215
01:29:15,615 --> 01:29:18,095
When did you get back?
- The next day, the 3rd.

1216
01:29:18,185 --> 01:29:20,096
Did the sermon last for <i>2</i> days'?

1217
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:23,262
Yes, but, we attended it only
on the 2nd.

1218
01:29:23,524 --> 01:29:25,868
After that, we stayed in a hotel...

1219
01:29:25,926 --> 01:29:28,100
...and saw a movie the next
day, before returning home.

1220
01:29:28,162 --> 01:29:29,231
I see.

1221
01:29:29,663 --> 01:29:32,667
Ma'am. Show us the attendance
register, please.

1222
01:29:33,134 --> 01:29:36,512
Let's see, whether she came
to school on the second.

1223
01:29:37,270 --> 01:29:39,546
There was a holiday
at school on the 2nd.

1224
01:29:39,606 --> 01:29:40,881
Gandhi Jayanti.

1225
01:29:40,975 --> 01:29:43,353
Right, and the 3rd was a
Sunday.

1226
01:29:43,411 --> 01:29:45,015
That's why we planned it.

1227
01:29:45,078 --> 01:29:46,682
So, you mean...

1228
01:29:46,747 --> 01:29:50,217
...you've never met Sam
after the camp.

1229
01:29:50,417 --> 01:29:51,896
No, sir.

1230
01:29:54,020 --> 01:29:55,863
Okay. Thank you.

1231
01:29:56,189 --> 01:29:58,363
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, ma'am.

1232
01:30:14,375 --> 01:30:16,354
Are you Vijay Salgaonkafs
wife'?

1233
01:30:17,712 --> 01:30:19,020
Yes.

1234
01:30:30,891 --> 01:30:33,895
Vijay! How come you are home
at this time'?

1235
01:30:35,162 --> 01:30:38,337
Anju's principal called Nandini and
informed her about your visit there.

1236
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:40,404
She got scared and called me.

1237
01:30:40,635 --> 01:30:42,774
I went to the station and
found out you're here.

1238
01:30:43,136 --> 01:30:44,707
I rushed home.

1239
01:30:45,006 --> 01:30:46,279
What has happened?

1240
01:30:46,506 --> 01:30:48,077
We need to question you.

1241
01:30:48,376 --> 01:30:49,945
Come in, lefs sit down.

1242
01:30:50,645 --> 01:30:52,750
Vijay, do you know this boy?

1243
01:30:53,581 --> 01:30:54,559
No, sir.

1244
01:30:54,916 --> 01:30:58,055
What about you?
- No, sir.

1245
01:30:59,953 --> 01:31:01,591
Have you seen this car'?

1246
01:31:02,422 --> 01:31:03,527
No sir.

1247
01:31:04,024 --> 01:31:05,265
What about you?

1248
01:31:06,260 --> 01:31:07,466
No, sir.

1249
01:31:10,864 --> 01:31:12,572
Let me be frank, here.

1250
01:31:13,301 --> 01:31:14,779
That's what I'd prefer, too.

1251
01:31:16,103 --> 01:31:19,015
This is IG Meera Deshmukh's
only son, Sam Deshmukh.

1252
01:31:19,606 --> 01:31:21,552
He is missing, since the last
25 days.

1253
01:31:23,010 --> 01:31:24,989
Last month, during the
nature camp, he met...

1254
01:31:25,046 --> 01:31:26,854
...your daughter, Anju.

1255
01:31:27,314 --> 01:31:31,354
We also have proof, he came here
in a yellow Hyundai Getz.

1256
01:31:32,185 --> 01:31:35,724
This car was recovered in the last
month from Paavelim Stone Quarry.

1257
01:31:37,257 --> 01:31:39,033
We came here for two reasons.

1258
01:31:39,292 --> 01:31:40,863
First, Anju knew Sam.

1259
01:31:41,429 --> 01:31:45,740
Secondly, Gaitonde saw you
driving Sam's car.

1260
01:31:46,667 --> 01:31:49,978
When you took the car past
Subhash Salvi's house...

1261
01:31:50,505 --> 01:31:51,813
...I was there.

1262
01:31:53,807 --> 01:31:55,878
We think, Sam came
to your place.

1263
01:31:55,943 --> 01:31:58,219
But, we weren't here on
the 2nd.

1264
01:31:58,311 --> 01:32:01,087
We went to Panaji for a sermon
and got back on the third.

1265
01:32:02,483 --> 01:32:03,654
Yes.

1266
01:32:04,252 --> 01:32:06,528
Vijay Salgaonkar, your
game is up.

1267
01:32:08,456 --> 01:32:09,935
Sir, what more proof do you need?

1268
01:32:11,391 --> 01:32:13,599
Don't you laugh at me!

1269
01:32:14,194 --> 01:32:16,105
I didn't even mention...

1270
01:32:16,162 --> 01:32:17,904
...which date Sam came to
your place.

1271
01:32:17,965 --> 01:32:19,466
But, your wife...

1272
01:32:19,966 --> 01:32:21,640
"blurted, without being asked.

1273
01:32:22,502 --> 01:32:25,006
Vijay, are you laughing at us'?
- No, sir.

1274
01:32:26,306 --> 01:32:27,809
Why should I laugh at the
police?

1275
01:32:28,643 --> 01:32:31,350
Look at her, she is
still shocked.

1276
01:32:31,878 --> 01:32:33,881
She doesn't know what
is going on.

1277
01:32:34,814 --> 01:32:37,091
You've really petrified her.

1278
01:32:38,019 --> 01:32:41,556
I told you, earlier, the principal
called Nandini.

1279
01:32:41,889 --> 01:32:44,869
She said, that you went to the
school, about a case.

1280
01:32:45,292 --> 01:32:47,363
You questioned Anju, too.

1281
01:32:47,427 --> 01:32:51,069
You know, the school authorities
panic in such situations.

1282
01:32:51,565 --> 01:32:55,342
They think, the case will
ruin the school's image.

1283
01:32:56,002 --> 01:32:58,609
So, the principal called Nandini
and told her all about it.

1284
01:32:59,039 --> 01:33:02,180
Even the dates.
Simple.

1285
01:33:02,877 --> 01:33:07,985
Gaitonde says he saw you driving
Sam's car on Sunday, the 3rd.

1286
01:33:08,916 --> 01:33:10,690
You didn't answer him.

1287
01:33:12,953 --> 01:33:15,264
There's no use.
- Why?

1288
01:33:15,957 --> 01:33:19,734
Because everyone knows
we can't stand each other.

1289
01:33:20,761 --> 01:33:23,400
No matter what I say
he will brand me a liar.

1290
01:33:24,131 --> 01:33:25,439
Forget about Gaitonde.

1291
01:33:25,832 --> 01:33:27,140
Tell me the truth.

1292
01:33:27,935 --> 01:33:29,573
H' Gaitonde saw me...

1293
01:33:30,203 --> 01:33:33,617
meither he's lying or he
is mistaken.

1294
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:36,881
Because, on 2nd October
from 8:00 am...

1295
01:33:37,310 --> 01:33:39,654
...to 3 October, till 5:00 pm.

1296
01:33:40,014 --> 01:33:41,720
My family and I were in Panaji.

1297
01:33:41,948 --> 01:33:43,552
Sir, he's lying.

1298
01:33:44,118 --> 01:33:45,926
I saw him, that day.

1299
01:33:47,287 --> 01:33:49,894
What did you do from 2nd
to the 3rd'?

1300
01:33:50,323 --> 01:33:52,735
Where did you go?

1301
01:33:53,994 --> 01:33:56,497
Can you give me the details?
- Of course.

1302
01:33:57,131 --> 01:33:59,132
On 2nd October, we took the
5:30 am bus...

1303
01:33:59,233 --> 01:34:00,404
...and headed to Panaji.

1304
01:34:23,623 --> 01:34:26,935
When you got back, was it raining?
- Yes, it was.

1305
01:34:27,662 --> 01:34:29,403
Nandini and the kids got
drenched.

1306
01:34:29,764 --> 01:34:31,606
So, they fell sick.

1307
01:34:31,931 --> 01:34:33,569
They missed school for
a couple of days.

1308
01:34:33,833 --> 01:34:35,141
Okay.

1309
01:34:35,435 --> 01:34:38,712
So, you kept the bills and tickets
just to show us, right'?

1310
01:34:40,041 --> 01:34:43,113
Sir, who ever keeps bus tickets?

1311
01:34:44,478 --> 01:34:47,515
Sir, we are middle class people.

1312
01:34:48,515 --> 01:34:50,426
We try to save, as
much as we can.

1313
01:34:51,752 --> 01:34:54,288
<i>We check 'the bills on 'the
last</i> day <i>oi 'the month.</i>

1314
01:34:55,122 --> 01:34:58,126
To find out the unnecessary
expenses and the savings.

1315
01:35:10,003 --> 01:35:14,510
I messed up, by talking
about the dates, right'?

1316
01:35:15,975 --> 01:35:17,113
Yes.

1317
01:35:18,412 --> 01:35:22,860
But, you explained everything
and sent them away.

1318
01:35:24,518 --> 01:35:26,360
They won't come back, right'?

1319
01:35:28,689 --> 01:35:30,895
Gaitonde, your allegations are
nonsense.

1320
01:35:31,591 --> 01:35:34,435
I think, Vijay and his family
actually went to Panaji.

1321
01:35:34,761 --> 01:35:37,470
Sir, I swear to you!
It was Vijay.

1322
01:35:37,832 --> 01:35:39,811
Sir, lefs remand him to custody.

1323
01:35:39,867 --> 01:35:42,779
He won't be so sharp
once he's beaten up a bit.

1324
01:35:44,704 --> 01:35:47,015
Anyway, inform the IG.

1325
01:35:47,108 --> 01:35:48,849
Sir, let's get hold oi Vijay, first.

1326
01:35:49,143 --> 01:35:51,520
What if we inform the
IG, later'?

1327
01:35:58,519 --> 01:36:00,692
Dad.
- Yes.

1328
01:36:01,855 --> 01:36:04,962
Did the police believe us'?

1329
01:36:07,661 --> 01:36:09,298
I don't know, dear.

1330
01:36:10,497 --> 01:36:12,636
Will they come back?

1331
01:36:14,568 --> 01:36:16,707
Yes, they will be back.

1332
01:36:26,713 --> 01:36:29,319
What is his name?
- Vijay Salgaonkar.

1333
01:36:29,817 --> 01:36:32,524
Are you sure, he was driving
Sam's car'?

1334
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:34,627
Ma'am, I don't remember
the license number.

1335
01:36:35,055 --> 01:36:37,228
But, that was a yellow
Hyundai Getz car.

1336
01:36:37,591 --> 01:36:40,902
But, are you sure, Vijay
Salgaonkar was driving it'?

1337
01:36:40,961 --> 01:36:42,907
Yes, sir. Absolutely sure.

1338
01:36:42,962 --> 01:36:45,603
But, they said, they were at
Panaji on the 2nd and 3rd.

1339
01:36:46,233 --> 01:36:48,645
Sir, they're lying.
- They're lying?

1340
01:36:49,703 --> 01:36:52,182
But, what about all the proof of
his trip'?

1341
01:36:52,439 --> 01:36:54,680
He showed us hotel
bills and bus tickets.

1342
01:36:54,942 --> 01:36:56,682
But, we will know if
they are real or fake...

1343
01:36:56,777 --> 01:36:59,189
...only after we check them, sir.

1344
01:37:01,247 --> 01:37:06,856
H' Gaitonde is right, those
bills must be forged.

1345
01:37:07,421 --> 01:37:10,560
That won't be too difficult
to find out.

1346
01:37:11,859 --> 01:37:15,829
After all, he is an illiterate,
fourth grade dropout.

1347
01:37:15,930 --> 01:37:17,603
He can't be too smart.

1348
01:37:18,265 --> 01:37:21,644
Tomorrow, bring Vijay,
his family...

1349
01:37:21,734 --> 01:37:25,273
...and all the evidence shown by
him to me.

1350
01:37:25,471 --> 01:37:27,349
But, on what charge
can we bring them in'?

1351
01:37:27,942 --> 01:37:30,786
Kidnapping. Not murder.

1352
01:37:31,045 --> 01:37:32,990
Because, we need a corpse
to prove that.

1353
01:37:34,215 --> 01:37:36,717
You don't worry about protocol.
<i>I'll</i> take care of it.

1354
01:37:41,921 --> 01:37:44,561
Uncle! Uncle!

1355
01:37:45,024 --> 01:37:47,301
Mr. Plane! You're here, early!

1356
01:37:47,595 --> 01:37:49,904
The police took Vijay and his
family in.

1357
01:37:59,873 --> 01:38:02,046
When did you leave for Panaji'?

1358
01:38:02,275 --> 01:38:05,086
Sir, we took a private bus
to Panaji at 5:30 am.

1359
01:38:05,179 --> 01:38:07,180
So where's that bus ticket?

1360
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:11,823
His friend owns the bus, so
the conductor didn't let us pay.

1361
01:38:11,886 --> 01:38:14,092
When did you reach the
venue of the sermon?

1362
01:38:15,288 --> 01:38:19,032
At 8:30 am. The sermon had
already begun.

1363
01:38:19,292 --> 01:38:23,240
I guess, about 8:30 am.

1364
01:38:23,296 --> 01:38:26,301
When we arrived, the
sermon had begun.

1365
01:38:26,399 --> 01:38:28,778
When did you reach the
venue of the sermon?

1366
01:38:33,006 --> 01:38:36,681
It our statements are exactly
alike, they may have doubts.

1367
01:38:37,011 --> 01:38:38,581
Especially when it comes to
timings.

1368
01:38:39,046 --> 01:38:40,992
Mom and I will give
the exact time.

1369
01:38:41,414 --> 01:38:43,155
You can skirt around it.

1370
01:38:43,216 --> 01:38:45,025
I don't remember the exact
time.

1371
01:38:45,085 --> 01:38:48,463
But, when we arrived
the sermon had begun.

1372
01:38:48,855 --> 01:38:52,735
What time did the sermon begin
after you got there'?

1373
01:38:55,261 --> 01:38:58,140
The police is going to try to
ask complicated questions.

1374
01:38:58,465 --> 01:39:01,673
Listen to them carefully,
and then answer.

1375
01:39:02,636 --> 01:39:06,015
The sermon began before
we reached there.

1376
01:39:06,506 --> 01:39:09,317
But, your mom and dad
said that...

1377
01:39:09,376 --> 01:39:12,823
...the sermon began
after you reached the venue.

1378
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:14,359
After half an hour.

1379
01:39:14,914 --> 01:39:18,055
They will lie about us
telling them something different.

1380
01:39:18,519 --> 01:39:21,431
But, stick to your story,
at all times.

1381
01:39:22,122 --> 01:39:25,466
No! When we arrived the
event had already begun.

1382
01:39:28,929 --> 01:39:29,930
Martin.
- This way.

1383
01:39:29,997 --> 01:39:31,738
What's the matter?
Where are they'?

1384
01:39:31,798 --> 01:39:33,403
They were taken in.
- They were?

1385
01:39:33,466 --> 01:39:34,912
These people aren't telling me
anything!

1386
01:39:34,969 --> 01:39:36,538
We want to go in.
- You're not allowed in.

1387
01:39:36,636 --> 01:39:37,774
He's Vijay's father-in-law.

1388
01:39:37,837 --> 01:39:39,215
I don't care who he is.
He's not allowed in and that's that.

1389
01:39:39,305 --> 01:39:40,546
How can you stop me'?

1390
01:39:40,640 --> 01:39:42,779
You have taken my daughter
into police custody, too!

1391
01:39:42,842 --> 01:39:44,185
Come on, open the gate...
- No!

1392
01:39:44,278 --> 01:39:45,586
No, get back.
- Open the gate.

1393
01:39:45,679 --> 01:39:48,056
Get back!
- Open the gate!

1394
01:39:48,381 --> 01:39:50,862
Later, we went to a restaurant
to eat food.

1395
01:39:51,018 --> 01:39:52,690
What was the name of the hotel'?

1396
01:39:55,689 --> 01:39:57,862
I don't remember that.

1397
01:39:58,391 --> 01:39:59,734
What did you eat'?

1398
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:01,166
Pav Bhaji.

1399
01:40:01,662 --> 01:40:02,970
What did the others eat'?

1400
01:40:03,063 --> 01:40:04,474
Everyone ate Pav Bhaji.

1401
01:40:04,731 --> 01:40:06,769
But, Anju said that...

1402
01:40:06,833 --> 01:40:09,109
...she ate fried rice.

1403
01:40:15,775 --> 01:40:18,381
No! She must have forgotten.

1404
01:40:18,479 --> 01:40:20,981
I remember, we all ate
Pav Bhaji.

1405
01:40:23,917 --> 01:40:25,190
Hello?

1406
01:40:25,685 --> 01:40:27,188
Yes, ifs me.
Tell me.

1407
01:40:27,921 --> 01:40:29,524
No, that's a lie.

1408
01:40:30,556 --> 01:40:31,899
Who told you that'?

1409
01:40:32,525 --> 01:40:35,769
See, I'm in a meeting, okay?
<i>I'll</i> have to call you back.

1410
01:40:36,162 --> 01:40:37,506
<i>I'll</i> call you back.

1411
01:40:39,733 --> 01:40:41,109
A reporter from India TV called.

1412
01:40:42,235 --> 01:40:44,306
They say, they have
information that...

1413
01:40:44,637 --> 01:40:46,878
...we arrested a family
in connection with Sam's case.

1414
01:40:46,974 --> 01:40:48,715
Forget about it.
I don't care, Mahesh.

1415
01:40:49,342 --> 01:40:50,650
What do you think'?

1416
01:40:50,711 --> 01:40:54,318
Ma'am, this family is even tougher
than we thought.

1417
01:40:54,881 --> 01:40:56,759
No one changed their
statements.

1418
01:40:56,850 --> 01:40:58,658
Specially, the younger
daughter, Anu.

1419
01:40:59,185 --> 01:41:02,530
I am surprised she stuck to her
story though she is so young!

1420
01:41:03,923 --> 01:41:06,125
That's spot on.
Absolutely correct.

1421
01:41:06,126 --> 01:41:09,335
How can a child stick to her
statement so firmly?

1422
01:41:09,496 --> 01:41:10,975
I am sure something is wrong,
ma'am.

1423
01:41:14,568 --> 01:41:16,672
Ifs possible, they
are all telling the truth.

1424
01:41:17,171 --> 01:41:19,810
So, they are sticking to their
statements. That's a possibility.

1425
01:41:19,872 --> 01:41:21,978
Perhaps, Gaitonde is mistaken.

1426
01:41:22,643 --> 01:41:23,780
No, Mahesh.

1427
01:41:23,844 --> 01:41:27,087
One thing is certain.
They know something about Sam.

1428
01:41:27,247 --> 01:41:29,055
But, Meera, their statements
so tar...

1429
01:41:29,149 --> 01:41:31,856
Mahesh, 'they're lying.
It's a cooked up story.

1430
01:41:31,918 --> 01:41:34,229
Ma'am, if they are lying...

1431
01:41:34,287 --> 01:41:35,698
...then, we can conduct
a lie detector test.

1432
01:41:35,756 --> 01:41:37,632
Are you stupid, Gaitonde'?

1433
01:41:37,890 --> 01:41:39,597
We can't conduct a lie detector
test, just like that!

1434
01:41:39,693 --> 01:41:41,467
We need a court order for that.

1435
01:41:41,662 --> 01:41:43,608
So, why can't we get
court orders?

1436
01:41:44,898 --> 01:41:48,003
To do that we have to prove
they are lying, in the court.

1437
01:41:48,101 --> 01:41:49,979
So far, all the evidence
we have found...

1438
01:41:50,037 --> 01:41:53,779
...proves the family wasn't there
on that weekend.

1439
01:41:54,942 --> 01:41:57,319
Sorry, I am sure you know
what you're doing.

1440
01:42:00,079 --> 01:42:01,752
Prabhu.
- Yes, ma'am.

1441
01:42:01,849 --> 01:42:03,886
They told us a story, right'?

1442
01:42:04,384 --> 01:42:06,523
So, bring all the characters
from that story here.

1443
01:42:06,886 --> 01:42:08,365
Got it'?
- Yes, ma'am.

1444
01:42:08,622 --> 01:42:09,793
Besides that...

1445
01:42:10,791 --> 01:42:14,533
...if Vijay is lying about the
trip to Panaji...

1446
01:42:14,927 --> 01:42:17,465
...then, there is someone
who saw him here.

1447
01:42:17,663 --> 01:42:18,836
Of course.

1448
01:42:18,931 --> 01:42:21,275
A boy called Jose works
in his office.

1449
01:42:21,335 --> 01:42:23,280
Is there any other place
which he visits, regularly?

1450
01:42:23,337 --> 01:42:24,337
Yes, ma'am.

1451
01:42:24,438 --> 01:42:26,280
There's a hotel named
Martin's Corner.

1452
01:42:26,340 --> 01:42:27,944
Ifs right in front of the police
station.

1453
01:42:28,007 --> 01:42:30,113
Vijay comes there, every day.
- Okay.

1454
01:42:30,777 --> 01:42:34,815
So, bring the office boy and
hotel manager here, tomorrow.

1455
01:42:35,015 --> 01:42:36,323
Okay, ma'am.

1456
01:42:37,684 --> 01:42:39,095
One more thing"

1457
01:42:40,287 --> 01:42:44,735
When the family leaves, they should
feel we believed their story.

1458
01:42:48,729 --> 01:42:53,939
I was really nervous during
the interrogation.

1459
01:42:54,902 --> 01:42:56,881
Luckily, they believed us.

1460
01:42:58,372 --> 01:43:00,283
Who said, they believed us'?

1461
01:43:01,307 --> 01:43:02,514
What do you mean?

1462
01:43:03,443 --> 01:43:05,979
They won't let us go, so easily.

1463
01:43:06,712 --> 01:43:08,055
They will be back.

1464
01:43:08,748 --> 01:43:10,524
They will be even better
prepared.

1465
01:43:16,756 --> 01:43:17,962
They will be back.

1466
01:43:18,725 --> 01:43:21,432
Why?
Vijay, what's 'the problem?

1467
01:43:22,595 --> 01:43:24,597
I am your brother-in-law.
At least, tell me.

1468
01:43:24,664 --> 01:43:27,407
Rajesh, every family
has some secrets...

1469
01:43:28,100 --> 01:43:29,978
mthat are best kept hidden.

1470
01:43:30,537 --> 01:43:33,211
I am sorry.
I can't tell you anything.

1471
01:43:33,506 --> 01:43:36,851
But, I will need your help.

1472
01:43:37,911 --> 01:43:39,015
What do you want me to do?

1473
01:43:42,882 --> 01:43:45,363
I have known Vijay
since he was a kid.

1474
01:43:45,786 --> 01:43:47,355
He's really good and decent.

1475
01:43:48,354 --> 01:43:50,028
With a heart of gold.

1476
01:43:50,090 --> 01:43:52,764
I don't recall asking whether
he has a heart of gold or silver.

1477
01:43:54,627 --> 01:43:58,905
How many times did he visit your
hotel on the 2nd of October?

1478
01:43:58,966 --> 01:44:00,809
Normally, he comes twice a day.

1479
01:44:00,900 --> 01:44:02,538
For evening tea, dinner.

1480
01:44:02,636 --> 01:44:04,274
And sometimes, he comes
over for lunch, too.

1481
01:44:04,337 --> 01:44:07,113
I guess, he came over twice
on the 2nd, too.

1482
01:44:11,345 --> 01:44:12,881
No, wait!

1483
01:44:13,412 --> 01:44:15,824
He wasn't here on the 2nd.

1484
01:44:16,216 --> 01:44:17,854
He went to Panaji for a sermon.

1485
01:44:17,917 --> 01:44:19,591
Then, why didn't you tell us
that before?

1486
01:44:19,886 --> 01:44:22,422
Sorry, sir.
I remembered it out of the blue.

1487
01:44:23,023 --> 01:44:26,060
A 'few days ago,
Vijay and I spoke about that.

1488
01:44:26,592 --> 01:44:28,731
What did he tell you about
the sermon?

1489
01:44:29,061 --> 01:44:31,337
He told me it was a very
good event.

1490
01:44:31,664 --> 01:44:35,613
He even told us what
Swami Chinmayanand said.

1491
01:44:35,836 --> 01:44:37,542
So, what did he say'?

1492
01:44:37,637 --> 01:44:39,948
He narrated one of
the Jataka fables.

1493
01:44:40,340 --> 01:44:43,617
It was 'the story oi 'the
king oi Benaras...

1494
01:44:43,676 --> 01:44:45,350
"defeating his enemy
with love and patience.

1495
01:44:45,412 --> 01:44:47,323
When did Vijay get back
from Panaji'?

1496
01:44:48,047 --> 01:44:50,085
The next day.
- At what time'?

1497
01:44:50,684 --> 01:44:52,493
I don't know that.

1498
01:44:52,551 --> 01:44:54,725
Because, he didn't come
to the office that day.

1499
01:44:54,787 --> 01:44:56,698
Did Vijay call you from Panaji'?

1500
01:44:57,923 --> 01:44:59,130
No.

1501
01:44:59,259 --> 01:45:01,796
Is Vijay Salgaonkar your friend?

1502
01:45:01,895 --> 01:45:03,238
Yes, he is.

1503
01:45:03,296 --> 01:45:05,833
Did he travel on your bus
recently?

1504
01:45:06,766 --> 01:45:08,109
Yes.

1505
01:45:08,167 --> 01:45:10,306
A few days ago.

1506
01:45:10,537 --> 01:45:13,279
And before that'?
- Before that'?

1507
01:45:13,806 --> 01:45:15,684
Right. On the 2nd.

1508
01:45:16,777 --> 01:45:19,417
Where was he going?
- To Panaji.

1509
01:45:20,247 --> 01:45:22,248
He was going to attend
some sermon.

1510
01:45:25,484 --> 01:45:29,057
Are you sure, those people
were at your lodge? - Yes, sir.

1511
01:45:29,122 --> 01:45:31,363
Are they your regular customers?

1512
01:45:31,891 --> 01:45:34,132
No, Sir.
- Then, how can you be sure...

1513
01:45:34,226 --> 01:45:36,434
mthat they were at
your lodge?

1514
01:45:38,664 --> 01:45:40,167
I need a double room.

1515
01:45:41,001 --> 01:45:42,707
Rs. 800 plus taxes.

1516
01:45:43,136 --> 01:45:45,810
What are you saying?
I have stayed here, before.

1517
01:45:46,172 --> 01:45:47,708
You didn't charge taxes
back then.

1518
01:45:48,175 --> 01:45:49,619
Then you won't get any bills.

1519
01:45:49,676 --> 01:45:51,177
That will do.

1520
01:45:54,914 --> 01:45:58,020
Listen, this lodge doesn't
seem to be good enough.

1521
01:45:58,085 --> 01:45:59,962
Let's go to a family hotel.

1522
01:46:00,052 --> 01:46:02,363
Come on, ma'am.
This is a family hotel.

1523
01:46:02,421 --> 01:46:04,765
Don't worry.
He's been here, before.

1524
01:46:05,292 --> 01:46:08,136
They checked the room first
and only then did they book it.

1525
01:46:08,228 --> 01:46:09,639
When did that happen?

1526
01:46:10,730 --> 01:46:12,141
I don't remember, sir.

1527
01:46:12,231 --> 01:46:15,145
Did they tell you why
they were in Panaji'?

1528
01:46:16,369 --> 01:46:17,849
No, I don't remember, sir.

1529
01:46:18,337 --> 01:46:20,318
Did you check their register?
- Yes, ma'am.

1530
01:46:20,774 --> 01:46:22,117
He has <i>2</i> registers.

1531
01:46:22,175 --> 01:46:24,587
One of them has
Vijay Salgaonkafs name.

1532
01:46:24,978 --> 01:46:27,219
There's a check in on 2nd
October. And...

1533
01:46:27,314 --> 01:46:29,418
...check out at 9:30 am
on the 3rd.

1534
01:46:29,515 --> 01:46:31,496
Why do you have two registers?

1535
01:46:32,853 --> 01:46:35,265
Why don't you answer ma'am'?

1536
01:46:36,055 --> 01:46:38,865
One register is for the billing
customers.

1537
01:46:38,925 --> 01:46:41,166
The other is for customers
who don't take bills.

1538
01:46:41,595 --> 01:46:44,074
Do you know, that's a crime?

1539
01:46:44,765 --> 01:46:46,836
How can you still remember
them'?

1540
01:46:47,134 --> 01:46:49,204
Good customers are hard
to forget.

1541
01:46:53,506 --> 01:46:55,145
You own the hotel.

1542
01:46:55,841 --> 01:46:56,877
Why? What's the matter?

1543
01:46:56,976 --> 01:46:59,752
No. I have never eaten
such tasty Pav Bhaji.

1544
01:47:00,247 --> 01:47:03,694
Honestly, my wife makes
that at home, but...

1545
01:47:04,684 --> 01:47:07,220
We are famous for Pav Bhaji
in the city of Panaji.

1546
01:47:07,287 --> 01:47:09,596
The hotel is really clean
and hygienic.

1547
01:47:09,855 --> 01:47:11,301
The service is excellent.

1548
01:47:11,591 --> 01:47:13,570
Once a hotel is famous,
these days...

1549
01:47:13,926 --> 01:47:16,270
...the service tends to get tacky.

1550
01:47:16,496 --> 01:47:18,737
But, you're not like that.
I really like that.

1551
01:47:19,765 --> 01:47:21,109
Thank you, sir.

1552
01:47:22,935 --> 01:47:25,644
Uncle, the Pav Bhaji was
really good.

1553
01:47:25,704 --> 01:47:28,515
Really?
Thank you.

1554
01:47:28,608 --> 01:47:30,985
What's your name, dear?
- Anu!

1555
01:47:31,077 --> 01:47:32,555
Very good.

1556
01:47:33,246 --> 01:47:35,055
Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

1557
01:47:35,548 --> 01:47:38,256
I admit, you would remember
customers who appreciate you.

1558
01:47:38,350 --> 01:47:40,887
But, how do you remember
which day...

1559
01:47:40,953 --> 01:47:42,729
...and why, they came to
Panaji.

1560
01:47:42,956 --> 01:47:44,697
They told me.

1561
01:47:45,358 --> 01:47:47,132
As a businessman...

1562
01:47:47,226 --> 01:47:48,899
Okay, okay, fine!

1563
01:47:49,395 --> 01:47:50,806
You can wait outside.

1564
01:47:54,301 --> 01:47:59,306
H' Vijay Salgaonkar met all these
people on 2nd and 3rd October...

1565
01:47:59,706 --> 01:48:02,345
...how can he be in Pondolem
at the same time'?

1566
01:48:03,042 --> 01:48:04,420
Ma'am, I don't know.

1567
01:48:04,511 --> 01:48:06,421
Now I am a bit confused, too.

1568
01:48:06,746 --> 01:48:08,350
Can I say something'?

1569
01:48:09,483 --> 01:48:11,827
H' you ask me, I believe...

1570
01:48:11,885 --> 01:48:13,728
...Vijay and his family
are telling the truth.

1571
01:48:14,587 --> 01:48:16,067
Perhaps, your man is lying.

1572
01:48:16,355 --> 01:48:18,768
No, sir.
I'm telling the truth.

1573
01:48:18,859 --> 01:48:20,565
It was Vijay Salgaonkar.

1574
01:48:20,793 --> 01:48:24,400
I will resign,
if I am proved wrong.

1575
01:48:28,068 --> 01:48:29,604
Did you speak to Swami
Chinmayanand'?

1576
01:48:29,668 --> 01:48:32,046
Yes, ma'am.
He was out of town.

1577
01:48:32,137 --> 01:48:34,048
He may be back by now.
- Call him.

1578
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:36,511
Given what you've told me...

1579
01:48:36,609 --> 01:48:40,056
...it seems, Vijay and his
family...

1580
01:48:40,145 --> 01:48:42,421
...were present at our
sermon, that day.

1581
01:48:42,916 --> 01:48:45,362
Because, every sermon of mine is
unique.

1582
01:48:45,719 --> 01:48:47,391
I never repeat it.

1583
01:48:47,953 --> 01:48:51,730
Perhaps, someone who attended
it told Vijay later.

1584
01:48:52,057 --> 01:48:56,904
But, it's not possible that someone
remembered all those details.

1585
01:48:58,265 --> 01:48:59,436
Thank you, Swamiji.

1586
01:49:08,475 --> 01:49:09,953
Where are dad and Anu'?

1587
01:49:10,676 --> 01:49:12,054
This is a digital projector.

1588
01:49:12,345 --> 01:49:14,484
I dream of having my own
theater in Pondolem.

1589
01:49:14,547 --> 01:49:15,685
Very good!

1590
01:49:15,748 --> 01:49:18,490
All the theaters have digital
projection, these days.

1591
01:49:18,551 --> 01:49:21,192
The costs are low
and the quality is pristine.

1592
01:49:21,421 --> 01:49:22,559
Dad.

1593
01:49:23,189 --> 01:49:25,567
My elder daughter and my wife.
- Hello.

1594
01:49:26,725 --> 01:49:28,171
Do you remember
when they came to you?

1595
01:49:28,261 --> 01:49:29,501
On the 3rd of this month.

1596
01:49:29,595 --> 01:49:31,074
How do you remember the date'?

1597
01:49:31,131 --> 01:49:32,974
He saw the first half of the
film...

1598
01:49:33,065 --> 01:49:34,773
...from the projection room.

1599
01:49:34,833 --> 01:49:37,507
And he also told me that, he...

1600
01:49:37,604 --> 01:49:39,777
...had come to Panaji for
a sermon.

1601
01:49:39,838 --> 01:49:41,318
And, he was staying in a lodge.

1602
01:49:41,373 --> 01:49:44,217
Get out.
Just get out!

1603
01:49:45,244 --> 01:49:48,521
Let's go. Go out.
Go on.

1604
01:49:48,582 --> 01:49:51,586
Meera. Come on.

1605
01:50:03,296 --> 01:50:05,002
Stop it.

1606
01:50:07,266 --> 01:50:08,439
Look at me.

1607
01:50:09,269 --> 01:50:12,216
Nothing will happen to Sam.
Okay? Just stop worrying.

1608
01:50:12,972 --> 01:50:14,350
We will find him.

1609
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:19,823
Don't worry and don't
lose hope.

1610
01:50:21,715 --> 01:50:23,524
I haven't given up, Mahesh.

1611
01:50:25,085 --> 01:50:26,927
But, I am a mom too.

1612
01:50:27,621 --> 01:50:29,100
I can't help that.

1613
01:50:29,788 --> 01:50:31,631
Stop crying-

1614
01:50:35,595 --> 01:50:36,903
Listen, this...

1615
01:50:37,463 --> 01:50:39,603
Is this investigation
taking the right course'?

1616
01:50:39,932 --> 01:50:42,105
Yes. I think so.

1617
01:50:44,503 --> 01:50:46,676
Then, why can't we unearth
any clues'?

1618
01:50:47,273 --> 01:50:49,980
All the clues and witnesses
seem to be in his favor.

1619
01:50:52,177 --> 01:50:53,815
I know, Mahesh.

1620
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:58,895
All the proof and witnesses
are in Vijay's favor.

1621
01:51:00,787 --> 01:51:02,858
But, I know he's lying.

1622
01:51:02,921 --> 01:51:04,902
They are all lying.

1623
01:51:05,524 --> 01:51:07,300
I can feel it.

1624
01:51:14,934 --> 01:51:18,643
The police can tell from the
way a person talks...

1625
01:51:19,506 --> 01:51:21,507
...whether he's lying or telling
the truth.

1626
01:51:25,345 --> 01:51:29,417
I underestimated him by
considering him uneducated.

1627
01:51:30,082 --> 01:51:31,493
That was a mistake.

1628
01:51:32,752 --> 01:51:37,222
He may be a 4th grade dropout, but
he is extremely cunning.

1629
01:51:37,590 --> 01:51:39,034
He is really wily.

1630
01:51:39,725 --> 01:51:42,229
Vijay Salgaonkar is a very
good man.

1631
01:51:42,828 --> 01:51:44,637
I have checked his records.

1632
01:51:45,664 --> 01:51:47,975
He came to this village
25 years ago.

1633
01:51:48,635 --> 01:51:51,877
First, a tea stall,
then a grocery shop.

1634
01:51:51,970 --> 01:51:53,644
A video library, a garage.

1635
01:51:53,707 --> 01:51:56,016
He worked in diverse places
and grew up.

1636
01:51:56,109 --> 01:51:58,555
Later, he started
up his own business.

1637
01:51:59,011 --> 01:52:00,354
He's a fourth grade dropout.

1638
01:52:00,412 --> 01:52:03,087
But, he knows Marathi, Hindi,
English and Konkani.

1639
01:52:03,182 --> 01:52:05,355
He says, he learnt
all that from watching films.

1640
01:52:06,019 --> 01:52:08,020
He does love movies.

1641
01:52:08,421 --> 01:52:10,264
He never misses out
a single film.

1642
01:52:15,561 --> 01:52:17,234
Films.

1643
01:52:18,997 --> 01:52:20,601
That's an important link.

1644
01:52:24,871 --> 01:52:26,110
Come on, lefs go!

1645
01:52:26,171 --> 01:52:27,548
Wait a bit.

1646
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:28,618
What is it'?

1647
01:52:28,675 --> 01:52:30,279
I forget to get money
tor the tickets.

1648
01:52:30,342 --> 01:52:32,220
Is there any ATM nearby?
I...

1649
01:52:32,311 --> 01:52:35,555
What is this? I will have to
hold up the bus for you.

1650
01:52:35,648 --> 01:52:37,149
There's an ATM up ahead,
go ahead and hurry back.

1651
01:52:37,216 --> 01:52:38,389
Two minutes.
- Go on.

1652
01:52:45,925 --> 01:52:48,837
Prabhu, get me all the CCTV footage
from that ATM.

1653
01:52:49,295 --> 01:52:50,796
Where is it'?
In Panaji'?

1654
01:52:50,896 --> 01:52:53,342
Taligaon bus stand,
5 kms away from Panaji.

1655
01:52:53,432 --> 01:52:55,537
When was the bus
scheduled to leave?

1656
01:52:55,635 --> 01:52:57,011
At 3:00 pm in the afternoon.

1657
01:52:57,337 --> 01:53:01,149
I want the CCTV footage
for the ATM...

1658
01:53:01,207 --> 01:53:03,448
...for 3rd October,
from 2:30 pm to 3:30 pm right now.

1659
01:53:04,277 --> 01:53:05,585
Sawant!

1660
01:53:06,179 --> 01:53:09,057
You meet thousands of
passengers, every day. - Yes.

1661
01:53:09,149 --> 01:53:12,926
Let's say, you remember
the family due to the ATM.

1662
01:53:13,319 --> 01:53:15,628
But, when did the family
go to Panaji'?

1663
01:53:15,721 --> 01:53:17,292
Why were they there'?

1664
01:53:17,390 --> 01:53:19,926
It is impossible to remember
all of that.

1665
01:53:20,025 --> 01:53:22,631
He told you something
25 days ago.

1666
01:53:22,729 --> 01:53:24,298
How do you still remember it'?

1667
01:53:24,396 --> 01:53:26,569
I don't remember.
He told me.

1668
01:53:26,632 --> 01:53:29,341
Yes, but, you were
told 25 days ago.

1669
01:53:29,435 --> 01:53:31,176
How can you still...
- No, I...

1670
01:53:31,503 --> 01:53:33,506
What do you mean?
- I mean...

1671
01:53:33,605 --> 01:53:35,210
...he told me that, when...

1672
01:53:35,307 --> 01:53:37,685
...we met again, recently.

1673
01:53:38,912 --> 01:53:40,686
Again?
- Yes.

1674
01:53:40,747 --> 01:53:42,090
When?

1675
01:53:43,248 --> 01:53:44,728
A few days ago.

1676
01:53:45,451 --> 01:53:46,725
Where?

1677
01:53:48,054 --> 01:53:49,396
Where did you meet him?

1678
01:53:52,759 --> 01:53:56,434
Uncle!
- Oh, how are you?

1679
01:53:57,396 --> 01:53:58,774
How come you're here?

1680
01:53:58,832 --> 01:54:00,640
Vijay, don't you remember him?

1681
01:54:00,733 --> 01:54:04,305
We came here for Chinmayanands
sermon on 2nd October.

1682
01:54:04,369 --> 01:54:07,442
When we were going back
the next day...

1683
01:54:07,506 --> 01:54:09,713
...he was the conductor
on our bus.

1684
01:54:09,809 --> 01:54:12,516
You went to withdraw cash
at the ATM...

1685
01:54:12,578 --> 01:54:14,819
Oh, right! On the 2nd, after
the sermon...

1686
01:54:14,881 --> 01:54:16,985
...we went back on the bus
on the 3rd.

1687
01:54:17,050 --> 01:54:18,722
You were the conductor on that bus.
- Right.

1688
01:54:18,818 --> 01:54:20,296
You forget everything!

1689
01:54:20,386 --> 01:54:22,262
Sorry, I...
- That's okay.

1690
01:54:22,354 --> 01:54:23,731
See you later.
- Okay.

1691
01:54:32,231 --> 01:54:34,404
Mr. Vasu, has the show begun'?

1692
01:54:34,466 --> 01:54:35,740
Ifs you!

1693
01:54:35,801 --> 01:54:38,145
No, there's still time.
Where is your family?

1694
01:54:38,203 --> 01:54:39,979
No, I am alone today.
- Okay.

1695
01:54:40,038 --> 01:54:41,449
There was a sermon on the
2nd, right'?

1696
01:54:41,506 --> 01:54:43,042
That's why the family was
with me.

1697
01:54:43,208 --> 01:54:45,689
We went shopping on the 3rd and
then came for a movie.

1698
01:54:45,744 --> 01:54:48,020
Atter that, we ate at the hotel
and then went back home.

1699
01:54:48,081 --> 01:54:50,027
Imagine how expensive
that can be.

1700
01:54:55,220 --> 01:54:56,198
Dinkar.

1701
01:54:56,389 --> 01:54:59,631
We went 'to 'the sermon
at Panaji on 'the 2nd on your bus.

1702
01:54:59,958 --> 01:55:01,494
You didn't accept any money
from me.

1703
01:55:01,594 --> 01:55:03,266
But, that won't happen today.

1704
01:55:04,096 --> 01:55:05,905
Let me buy the tickets today.

1705
01:55:05,965 --> 01:55:08,002
Don't do that!

1706
01:55:08,734 --> 01:55:10,612
Why don't you tell him?

1707
01:55:10,670 --> 01:55:13,047
She won't say anything to me!
Here, give me tickets.

1708
01:55:17,710 --> 01:55:19,189
You've come after a while, sir.

1709
01:55:19,244 --> 01:55:22,488
No, we were here on 'the
2nd 'for 'the sermon at Panaji.

1710
01:55:22,547 --> 01:55:27,087
We visited exactly a day
after the sermon.

1711
01:55:27,185 --> 01:55:28,688
On 3rd October.

1712
01:55:28,755 --> 01:55:30,029
Right.

1713
01:55:30,088 --> 01:55:31,625
Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

1714
01:55:35,962 --> 01:55:39,273
3 weeks? - I told you, I'm going to
Panaji for the sermon.

1715
01:55:39,332 --> 01:55:42,141
I told you to pay this
the day after I got back.

1716
01:55:42,801 --> 01:55:45,112
Yes.
- When did I go to Panaji'?

1717
01:55:45,171 --> 01:55:47,344
Well...

1718
01:55:47,439 --> 01:55:49,317
On Saturday, the 2nd of October.

1719
01:55:49,876 --> 01:55:51,548
Yes.
- When did I go?

1720
01:55:52,211 --> 01:55:53,689
On Saturday, the 2nd of October.

1721
01:55:53,746 --> 01:55:57,488
When did I get back?
On Sunday the 3rd of October.

1722
01:55:58,051 --> 01:56:01,088
Yes, you got back on Sunday,
3rd October.

1723
01:56:01,186 --> 01:56:03,895
The next day on 4th October,
a Monday...

1724
01:56:03,957 --> 01:56:05,731
...I told you to pay this.

1725
01:56:06,192 --> 01:56:07,603
Yes.
- Go and pay it.

1726
01:56:10,796 --> 01:56:13,743
The other king was reformed
by his example.

1727
01:56:15,100 --> 01:56:17,637
The moral of this story
is, we must cultivate...

1728
01:56:18,438 --> 01:56:21,180
...the power to forgive others.

1729
01:56:23,810 --> 01:56:25,653
Great! Very good!

1730
01:56:27,079 --> 01:56:29,320
But, how did you hear
that story'?

1731
01:56:29,849 --> 01:56:31,886
I told you, we went to Panaji...

1732
01:56:31,984 --> 01:56:34,090
...to attend Swami Chinmayanands
sermon.

1733
01:56:34,186 --> 01:56:35,529
When?

1734
01:56:35,787 --> 01:56:37,358
Did you forget, already?

1735
01:56:37,556 --> 01:56:39,695
We went on the 2nd,
it was a Saturday.

1736
01:56:39,891 --> 01:56:41,564
And we got back on the 3rd.

1737
01:56:43,496 --> 01:56:44,838
That's where I heard
this story.

1738
01:56:47,300 --> 01:56:48,836
Okay.

1739
01:56:49,402 --> 01:56:52,280
Ma'am. Swami Chinmayanand.

1740
01:56:54,774 --> 01:56:55,877
Yes, Swamiji.

1741
01:56:55,975 --> 01:56:59,582
My followers record my sermons.

1742
01:57:00,078 --> 01:57:03,582
They are provided to the devotees
via DVDs.

1743
01:57:04,016 --> 01:57:06,054
The devotees can make bookings.

1744
01:57:06,685 --> 01:57:10,064
They can pick them up from the
ashram, within <i>2</i> weeks.

1745
01:57:10,456 --> 01:57:13,561
I have seen the booking list
tor the sermon on the 2nd.

1746
01:57:13,626 --> 01:57:16,300
But, Vijay Salgaonkafs
name doesn't feature in it.

1747
01:57:16,996 --> 01:57:18,565
Alright, thank you so much.

1748
01:57:20,166 --> 01:57:22,975
Possibly, he booked it
under another name.

1749
01:57:23,435 --> 01:57:24,608
Ifs possible.

1750
01:57:25,438 --> 01:57:29,318
But it doesn't prove he wasn't
in Panaji on the 2nd and 3rd.

1751
01:57:29,375 --> 01:57:33,050
Ma'am, the CCTV footage for
the ICICI Bank.

1752
01:58:07,246 --> 01:58:08,417
No.

1753
01:58:13,319 --> 01:58:14,957
Ifs over, finished.

1754
01:58:16,521 --> 01:58:18,024
Vijay was telling the truth.
- But, sir...

1755
01:58:18,091 --> 01:58:19,899
We have wasted so much time!

1756
01:58:22,228 --> 01:58:25,072
It may have been better
to try to find Sam instead.

1757
01:58:25,497 --> 01:58:27,738
But, I really...
- Gaitonde.

1758
01:58:28,333 --> 01:58:30,041
But, what more proof
do you want now'?

1759
01:58:32,537 --> 01:58:34,518
Ifs over, ifs finished.

1760
01:58:37,009 --> 01:58:38,511
But...

1761
01:58:40,046 --> 01:58:43,493
Meera. Our investigation hinges
on the fact, that...

1762
01:58:43,548 --> 01:58:46,722
...whether Vijay was in Panaji on
the 2nd and 3rd, or not'?

1763
01:58:47,587 --> 01:58:49,395
The camera doesn't lie, Meera!

1764
01:58:50,957 --> 01:58:54,461
The CCTV proves, that Vijay was
in Panaji on the 3rd.

1765
01:59:02,033 --> 01:59:05,880
Vijay was in Panaji on the 3rd.

1766
01:59:10,877 --> 01:59:14,586
Vijay was in Panaji on
the 3rd, too!

1767
01:59:17,350 --> 01:59:18,590
Makes sense.

1768
01:59:21,420 --> 01:59:24,025
That means...
- Meera.

1769
01:59:25,992 --> 01:59:31,168
Mahesh, he knew we were going
to watch this CCTV footage.

1770
01:59:31,264 --> 01:59:33,608
In fact, he wanted us to see it.

1771
01:59:34,432 --> 01:59:37,277
That was part of his plan, Mahesh.
- What plan, Meera'?

1772
01:59:39,704 --> 01:59:41,844
It was an amazing plan.

1773
01:59:53,786 --> 01:59:57,233
At about 8:30 am.
- The sermon had started by then.

1774
01:59:57,289 --> 01:59:58,962
Vijay wasn't here on the 2nd.

1775
01:59:59,057 --> 02:00:02,163
He saw the entire first halt
ot the film in the projection room.

1776
02:00:02,295 --> 02:00:04,002
No one forgets about
good customers, ma'am.

1777
02:00:04,063 --> 02:00:07,203
He told me about that, recently
again, when we met.

1778
02:00:07,300 --> 02:00:10,577
We had come to Panaji for
a sermon, on the 2nd.

1779
02:00:11,570 --> 02:00:13,710
He just recreated that day.

1780
02:00:15,807 --> 02:00:17,617
In fact, both the days.

1781
02:00:18,978 --> 02:00:20,979
The 2nd and 3rd of October.

1782
02:00:21,180 --> 02:00:22,488
What do you mean?

1783
02:00:22,582 --> 02:00:24,755
What do we usually remember?

1784
02:00:26,351 --> 02:00:28,490
Something we have seen
for ourselves.

1785
02:00:29,555 --> 02:00:30,966
Visuals.

1786
02:00:32,123 --> 02:00:33,466
Visuals.

1787
02:00:34,393 --> 02:00:38,000
Something we see,
can't be easily forgotten.

1788
02:00:40,865 --> 02:00:43,710
Visual memories are
the strongest memories.

1789
02:00:45,037 --> 02:00:46,515
For example, cinema.

1790
02:00:46,671 --> 02:00:51,087
You know, the stories you are
watching are not real.

1791
02:00:52,278 --> 02:00:54,224
But, you still believe in them.

1792
02:00:55,581 --> 02:00:59,323
Because, you have seen the story
and lived it in a way.

1793
02:00:59,518 --> 02:01:00,997
In the same way...

1794
02:01:01,354 --> 02:01:05,802
...Vijay and his family not only
concocted the story about Panaji...

1795
02:01:06,626 --> 02:01:08,400
...in fact, they lived it out.

1796
02:01:10,662 --> 02:01:12,664
They actually went to Panaji.

1797
02:01:12,998 --> 02:01:14,478
They stayed at a lodge.

1798
02:01:14,667 --> 02:01:16,408
They did eat the Pav Bhaji.

1799
02:01:16,569 --> 02:01:18,947
He sat in the projection
room and watched the film.

1800
02:01:19,372 --> 02:01:23,012
So, they stuck to their statements,
during the interrogation.

1801
02:01:23,175 --> 02:01:25,246
Because, they were telling
the truth.

1802
02:01:25,411 --> 02:01:27,152
Apart from one little detail.

1803
02:01:28,280 --> 02:01:29,760
What was that'?

1804
02:01:30,216 --> 02:01:33,425
They didn't do all that
on 'the 2nd and 3rd oi October.

1805
02:01:33,918 --> 02:01:35,193
They did that, some other day.

1806
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:36,693
Perhaps, the next day.

1807
02:01:36,788 --> 02:01:38,131
Ma'am.

1808
02:01:38,323 --> 02:01:41,463
Vijay said, it was raining
on the way back, they were drenched.

1809
02:01:41,527 --> 02:01:43,301
And his family fell sick.

1810
02:01:43,462 --> 02:01:46,806
He also said, his kids missed
school for a few days.

1811
02:01:46,865 --> 02:01:49,038
He showed us the medical bills
too.

1812
02:01:49,301 --> 02:01:52,511
You can get fake medical bills
very easily, Sawant.

1813
02:01:52,771 --> 02:01:56,743
Anyway, he's been throwing
bills at us from the word go.

1814
02:01:58,109 --> 02:02:00,783
But, there is an entry in the
lodge register for the 2nd.

1815
02:02:01,346 --> 02:02:04,055
The bus and film tickets tor the
3rd are authentic, right'?

1816
02:02:04,182 --> 02:02:05,594
That's a valid point, ma'am.

1817
02:02:07,886 --> 02:02:12,029
Very well played, fourth grade
dropout, Vijay Salgaonkar.

1818
02:02:14,359 --> 02:02:16,465
But, I know how you did that.

1819
02:02:18,163 --> 02:02:20,974
Vijay went to Panaji on 3rd October
in Sam's car.

1820
02:02:21,167 --> 02:02:23,373
He took a take away from
a restaurant.

1821
02:02:23,703 --> 02:02:26,842
Then, he probably
bought a used phone.

1822
02:02:27,273 --> 02:02:29,219
He put Sam's SIM card into it.

1823
02:02:29,375 --> 02:02:32,787
Then, he dumped the phone into
a truck with a national permit.

1824
02:02:33,412 --> 02:02:37,655
Then, he probably dumped Sam's
car into the lake at the quarry.

1825
02:02:38,149 --> 02:02:42,292
Then, he went back to a restaurant
and bought tour Pav Bhaji takeouts.

1826
02:02:42,520 --> 02:02:45,161
He purchased tour tickets
to the cinema, on that day.

1827
02:02:45,423 --> 02:02:47,233
Then, he went to Taligaon
bus stand...

1828
02:02:47,426 --> 02:02:50,805
...and withdrew the money
from the ATM at 3:00 pm.

1829
02:02:52,797 --> 02:02:55,368
Then, he took a Kadamba bus...

1830
02:02:55,734 --> 02:02:58,078
...bought 4 tickets and got back
to Pondolenn.

1831
02:02:59,104 --> 02:03:00,448
He went to his office at night.

1832
02:03:00,639 --> 02:03:04,609
He told Jose, he was going for
the sermon, the next day.

1833
02:03:05,043 --> 02:03:06,886
The next morning
he took his family...

1834
02:03:06,945 --> 02:03:09,448
...and travelled by Dinkar's private
bus to Panaji.

1835
02:03:09,614 --> 02:03:13,494
Vijay told him he was going to
Panaji for the sermon.

1836
02:03:13,685 --> 02:03:17,828
On reaching Panaji, he may have
reached the hermitage at 9:00 am.

1837
02:03:18,157 --> 02:03:21,331
Then, they spent the whole
day at the ashram.

1838
02:03:21,827 --> 02:03:25,569
Meanwhile, he found out
about the DVDs for the sermon.

1839
02:03:25,831 --> 02:03:28,903
He booked it under an
assumed name.

1840
02:03:29,769 --> 02:03:31,680
They arrived at Rishabh Lodge
in the evening.

1841
02:03:32,270 --> 02:03:35,444
Then, I guess, while 'the manager
gave Nandini 'the 'tour...

1842
02:03:35,640 --> 02:03:39,453
...\/ijay filled his name in
'the entries 'for 'the 2nd.

1843
02:03:39,845 --> 02:03:42,552
Then, when the manager returned
he disguised his handwriting...

1844
02:03:42,614 --> 02:03:44,560
...and took the room under
an assumed name.

1845
02:03:44,716 --> 02:03:46,627
They ate out at night.

1846
02:03:46,886 --> 02:03:49,798
The next day, they ordered
food from the same restaurant...

1847
02:03:49,954 --> 02:03:52,332
...where he bought 'the
'take aways on 'the 3rd.

1848
02:03:52,490 --> 02:03:55,664
After checking out of the lodge,
he took his family to the hotel...

1849
02:03:55,860 --> 02:03:58,899
...where he had order four Pav
Bhaji takeaways.

1850
02:03:59,064 --> 02:04:02,238
Again, they ate pav bhaji there.

1851
02:04:02,568 --> 02:04:04,912
They made friends with the owner
while paying the bill.

1852
02:04:05,104 --> 02:04:06,605
Then, they watched a film.

1853
02:04:06,704 --> 02:04:09,548
They got acquainted
with the projectionist.

1854
02:04:11,676 --> 02:04:14,453
Later, while withdrawing money
from the ATM at the bus stand...

1855
02:04:14,546 --> 02:04:16,253
...Vijay got off the bus.

1856
02:04:18,617 --> 02:04:19,993
But, he didn't enter the ATM.

1857
02:04:24,189 --> 02:04:27,501
They made 'friends with 'the
conductor on 'the Kadamba bus.

1858
02:04:28,961 --> 02:04:30,462
They got back home and
a few days later...

1859
02:04:30,628 --> 02:04:34,667
...Vijay watched the sermon
with his family.

1860
02:04:34,899 --> 02:04:38,073
Then, he destroyed all
the bills for the fifth.

1861
02:04:38,503 --> 02:04:42,384
He showed us bills for the 3rd.

1862
02:04:43,141 --> 02:04:46,555
A few days later he went back
to Panaji with his family.

1863
02:04:47,112 --> 02:04:48,819
He met everyone, once again.

1864
02:04:49,414 --> 02:04:52,190
Then, he very cleverly,
talked to them...

1865
02:04:52,384 --> 02:04:54,989
...and implied...

1866
02:04:55,453 --> 02:04:59,560
mthat, he and his family went
to Panaji on the 2nd for a sermon.

1867
02:04:59,992 --> 02:05:02,471
He got back on the evening
of 3rd October.

1868
02:05:02,962 --> 02:05:06,408
So, they all didn't realize they
were giving false testimonies.

1869
02:05:11,737 --> 02:05:13,944
They kept thinking
they were telling the truth.

1870
02:05:19,078 --> 02:05:20,784
Master stroke.

1871
02:05:25,850 --> 02:05:27,853
So, Vijay Salgaonkar...

1872
02:05:29,954 --> 02:05:32,798
...mocked the entire
police department.

1873
02:05:33,658 --> 02:05:36,902
And despite knowing
about all of that...

1874
02:05:36,996 --> 02:05:40,671
...we have no proof or evidence
against him.

1875
02:05:41,867 --> 02:05:43,710
All we have is a theory.

1876
02:05:48,506 --> 02:05:51,043
Without proof or witnesses...

1877
02:05:51,710 --> 02:05:54,212
...a confession is
the greatest evidence.

1878
02:05:55,547 --> 02:05:56,652
What do you mean?

1879
02:05:58,050 --> 02:05:59,756
Where are you taking me'?
- Come on!

1880
02:05:59,818 --> 02:06:01,524
Let him go!
- Come on!

1881
02:06:01,619 --> 02:06:03,792
Don't shout!
- Come on.

1882
02:06:03,855 --> 02:06:05,460
Let me go, sir.
- Get in.

1883
02:06:05,524 --> 02:06:07,970
Take them all away!
- Get in, come on!

1884
02:06:08,027 --> 02:06:09,631
How can they take them away?

1885
02:06:09,694 --> 02:06:11,197
Let us go!

1886
02:06:19,537 --> 02:06:21,279
I will need your help.

1887
02:06:22,507 --> 02:06:25,454
What do you want me to do?
- h' the police takes us again...

1888
02:06:27,078 --> 02:06:28,614
...just call these people.

1889
02:06:56,074 --> 02:06:57,382
Where is my son?

1890
02:06:58,877 --> 02:07:00,117
I don't know.

1891
02:07:01,380 --> 02:07:03,222
We weren't at home.

1892
02:07:05,016 --> 02:07:07,257
Do you think, the police are fools'?

1893
02:07:07,953 --> 02:07:10,432
We have figured out your
plan, Vijay.

1894
02:07:10,555 --> 02:07:12,502
Ifs no use lying, now.

1895
02:07:12,791 --> 02:07:15,135
We know, you were
not in Panaji on the 2nd or 3rd.

1896
02:07:15,327 --> 02:07:17,068
You were there on the 4th and
the 5th.

1897
02:07:18,262 --> 02:07:20,708
You didn't attend any sermon.

1898
02:07:31,710 --> 02:07:33,552
Why did my son come to
meet you?

1899
02:07:35,213 --> 02:07:36,988
What happened with
the two of you?

1900
02:07:37,716 --> 02:07:41,162
I never met Sam after
the camp. Really.

1901
02:07:42,320 --> 02:07:43,595
Listen to me.

1902
02:07:44,390 --> 02:07:46,426
I've had enough
of your stories.

1903
02:07:46,625 --> 02:07:47,899
Ifs over.

1904
02:07:48,726 --> 02:07:51,172
You better tell me the truth.

1905
02:07:52,197 --> 02:07:54,871
Or we have other ways to
do this.

1906
02:07:56,301 --> 02:07:59,338
I'm telling the truth,
I don't know anything.

1907
02:08:12,818 --> 02:08:14,694
You know how I feel, don't you?

1908
02:08:15,386 --> 02:08:16,990
After all, you are a mom.

1909
02:08:17,890 --> 02:08:19,163
Tell me the truth.

1910
02:08:20,926 --> 02:08:23,405
My son came to meet your daughter
and vanished.

1911
02:08:24,762 --> 02:08:25,969
What happened with them'?

1912
02:08:27,065 --> 02:08:29,876
We have already told the truth.

1913
02:08:35,506 --> 02:08:36,417
Gaitonde!

1914
02:08:47,453 --> 02:08:48,988
Tell me, whafs the truth'?

1915
02:08:49,755 --> 02:08:51,029
Tell me!

1916
02:08:51,222 --> 02:08:52,201
Tell me, what is it'?

1917
02:08:52,291 --> 02:08:54,167
Please, don't!
- Get back!

1918
02:08:54,493 --> 02:08:55,971
Speak u I _ Dacup.

1919
02:08:58,296 --> 02:08:59,570
Tell me!

1920
02:09:04,703 --> 02:09:06,876
Let's see, how much you
can take.

1921
02:09:07,372 --> 02:09:10,478
Tell me!

1922
02:09:10,943 --> 02:09:12,114
Dad!

1923
02:09:13,712 --> 02:09:15,555
Tell me! Where is Sam?

1924
02:09:15,713 --> 02:09:17,454
Tell me!

1925
02:09:17,983 --> 02:09:19,359
Tell me!
- Don't hit him.

1926
02:09:19,451 --> 02:09:20,828
What the heck!

1927
02:09:22,320 --> 02:09:23,595
Tell me!

1928
02:09:25,757 --> 02:09:27,135
You better tell me.

1929
02:09:28,761 --> 02:09:30,296
Please, ma'am.

1930
02:09:30,628 --> 02:09:33,542
Please, tell him to stop.

1931
02:09:34,166 --> 02:09:36,237
Please!

1932
02:09:37,269 --> 02:09:38,577
Speak up!

1933
02:09:39,637 --> 02:09:40,945
Please!

1934
02:09:42,740 --> 02:09:43,878
Gaitonde!

1935
02:10:06,331 --> 02:10:07,810
Where is my son?

1936
02:10:15,373 --> 02:10:17,149
Speak up!
- Come on!

1937
02:10:17,242 --> 02:10:19,586
Come on, speak up!

1938
02:10:22,280 --> 02:10:23,588
Tell me!

1939
02:10:23,881 --> 02:10:25,360
Tell ma'am where her son is!

1940
02:10:25,449 --> 02:10:27,452
Tell her, where is Sam?

1941
02:10:27,853 --> 02:10:29,798
Tell her!
Speak up!

1942
02:10:31,722 --> 02:10:32,860
Tell her!

1943
02:10:35,828 --> 02:10:37,501
He came to meet you, right'?

1944
02:10:37,563 --> 02:10:39,804
Tell us where is Sam?
- Go on!

1945
02:10:39,864 --> 02:10:41,172
Speak up!
_

1946
02:10:46,671 --> 02:10:48,117
Tell us, where is Sam?

1947
02:10:50,175 --> 02:10:51,551
Alex is here.

1948
02:10:51,944 --> 02:10:53,082
Send him in.
- Tell us!

1949
02:10:55,948 --> 02:10:59,087
Tell us, where is Sam?
- Meera, tell them to stop, please.

1950
02:11:00,051 --> 02:11:02,497
Alex is here.
- Speak up!

1951
02:11:03,154 --> 02:11:04,327
Tell us, where is Sam?

1952
02:11:04,422 --> 02:11:05,697
Okay, stop it.

1953
02:11:11,796 --> 02:11:13,002
Come with me.

1954
02:11:25,810 --> 02:11:27,256
You...
- Gaitonde, stop it!

1955
02:11:30,381 --> 02:11:31,417
Get back.

1956
02:11:37,488 --> 02:11:40,162
Vijay, tell me what you know.

1957
02:11:42,394 --> 02:11:44,670
DO YPU people enjoy
Qefilng bashed up?

1958
02:11:47,365 --> 02:11:50,404
I'm telling the truth.
I don't know anything.

1959
02:11:52,938 --> 02:11:54,679
Do you know this girl'?

1960
02:11:56,641 --> 02:11:57,814
No, aunt.

1961
02:12:00,912 --> 02:12:04,257
Alex. Sam was with you
at the nature camp.

1962
02:12:05,550 --> 02:12:08,121
Sam is missing for 26 days.
You know that.

1963
02:12:09,020 --> 02:12:11,524
I am sure, she is connected
to his disappearance.

1964
02:12:11,590 --> 02:12:14,695
So, please, if you have
any information...

1965
02:12:14,792 --> 02:12:16,295
...do tell us, right now.

1966
02:12:16,728 --> 02:12:18,365
Uncle, I don't know anything.

1967
02:12:18,462 --> 02:12:22,502
You called Sam on the day
he vanished. Correct?

1968
02:12:23,001 --> 02:12:25,412
But, you refused to
admit to it the other day.

1969
02:12:26,637 --> 02:12:28,708
Are you going to tell me,
or should I tell them'?

1970
02:12:29,041 --> 02:12:32,113
Aunt, I spoke to him, but...

1971
02:12:32,344 --> 02:12:34,551
...he didn't tell me
where he was.

1972
02:12:34,613 --> 02:12:36,752
How is she connected to Sam?

1973
02:12:37,215 --> 02:12:39,286
Tell me, or I am going
to slap you.

1974
02:12:41,252 --> 02:12:42,425
<i>I'll</i> tell <i>you.</i>

1975
02:13:09,280 --> 02:13:10,418
Stay here.

1976
02:13:21,259 --> 02:13:22,738
Hey, bro! Send this to me.

1977
02:13:23,161 --> 02:13:25,003
Sorry, not yet.

1978
02:13:25,262 --> 02:13:27,743
Why? Send it!
- Not now.

1979
02:13:28,600 --> 02:13:30,944
First, I should make use of this.

1980
02:14:09,173 --> 02:14:11,381
Ma'am. There is a huge
crowd outside.

1981
02:14:12,243 --> 02:14:14,349
The media is asking for you.

1982
02:14:14,412 --> 02:14:15,653
Tell them to get lost.

1983
02:14:15,947 --> 02:14:17,358
Don't let them get in.

1984
02:14:17,416 --> 02:14:18,917
Call for reinforcements,
if needed.

1985
02:14:28,393 --> 02:14:29,599
Now what'?

1986
02:14:32,430 --> 02:14:33,932
What do we do?

1987
02:14:37,636 --> 02:14:39,012
We'll end this.

1988
02:14:44,943 --> 02:14:46,149
Go out, everyone.

1989
02:14:49,314 --> 02:14:50,815
Gaitonde, you stay here.

1990
02:14:57,622 --> 02:15:00,193
I found out about
the video clip.

1991
02:15:01,725 --> 02:15:03,103
Where is Sam?

1992
02:15:05,130 --> 02:15:06,768
We don't know, ma'am.

1993
02:15:07,565 --> 02:15:08,976
I'm telling the truth.

1994
02:15:19,478 --> 02:15:21,082
Gaitonde, I want the truth.

1995
02:15:22,279 --> 02:15:24,817
Do whatever it takes.
- Yes, ma'am.

1996
02:15:27,918 --> 02:15:29,125
You darn...

1997
02:15:29,320 --> 02:15:30,890
Where is Sam?

1998
02:15:31,422 --> 02:15:34,563
Tell me, where is Sam?
Tell me!

1999
02:15:34,792 --> 02:15:35,930
Tell me!

2000
02:15:37,628 --> 02:15:39,073
You tell me!

2001
02:15:39,831 --> 02:15:41,777
Tell me, where is Sam?
- No!

2002
02:15:41,832 --> 02:15:43,335
Where is Sam?
- Mom!

2003
02:15:43,400 --> 02:15:45,403
Tell me!
Don't you know?

2004
02:15:45,470 --> 02:15:46,539
Leave her.

2005
02:15:46,837 --> 02:15:48,215
You must know!

2006
02:15:48,606 --> 02:15:50,814
Tell me, what did you
do to Sam?

2007
02:15:50,876 --> 02:15:52,877
I don't know.
- You don't know?

2008
02:15:53,511 --> 02:15:55,320
Tell me!

2009
02:15:58,315 --> 02:15:59,851
Are you obstructing a police officer?

2010
02:16:00,752 --> 02:16:02,230
Are you holding
the police back?

2011
02:16:06,625 --> 02:16:08,297
You!
Get lost!

2012
02:16:09,927 --> 02:16:11,305
Are you holding
the police back?

2013
02:16:11,896 --> 02:16:13,466
Are you holding
the police back?

2014
02:16:13,664 --> 02:16:15,405
Are you holding
the police back?

2015
02:16:16,167 --> 02:16:18,546
Are you going to talk?

2016
02:16:18,636 --> 02:16:20,377
Tell me, where is Sam?

2017
02:16:20,471 --> 02:16:21,882
I don't know, sir.
- You don't know?

2018
02:16:21,972 --> 02:16:23,179
You don't know?

2019
02:16:23,274 --> 02:16:25,481
Listen, I am going
to kill all of you.

2020
02:16:26,377 --> 02:16:27,550
Tell me.

2021
02:16:27,979 --> 02:16:29,014
Won't you tell me'?

2022
02:16:29,079 --> 02:16:30,252
I don't know.

2023
02:16:30,649 --> 02:16:31,719
You don't know?

2024
02:16:31,815 --> 02:16:32,816
Tell me.
- Mom! No.

2025
02:16:33,385 --> 02:16:35,058
Meera, stop him.
Please.

2026
02:16:35,586 --> 02:16:37,361
Tell me.
Where is Sam?

2027
02:16:37,422 --> 02:16:38,764
I don't know.

2028
02:16:38,856 --> 02:16:40,063
You don't know?

2029
02:17:14,593 --> 02:17:17,835
Look! h' I hit them a bit
more...

2030
02:17:18,563 --> 02:17:21,840
...your mom, dad and sister
will die.

2031
02:17:23,801 --> 02:17:26,372
It you don't want that
tell the truth.

2032
02:17:27,838 --> 02:17:29,512
No...
- Tell us.

2033
02:17:32,377 --> 02:17:34,515
Tell me.

2034
02:17:39,351 --> 02:17:43,025
Listen, I'm going to kill
them all. Will that do?

2035
02:17:44,289 --> 02:17:45,631
Tell me, are you okay
with that'?

2036
02:18:00,672 --> 02:18:01,878
Gaitonde.

2037
02:18:07,679 --> 02:18:10,558
She won't speak before
the parents. Send them away.

2038
02:18:16,021 --> 02:18:17,363
Please.

2039
02:18:18,255 --> 02:18:22,762
H' you know anything about
Sam, tell us!

2040
02:18:29,400 --> 02:18:30,879
Where is Anu'?

2041
02:18:32,170 --> 02:18:33,672
My daughter is in there.
- Wait.

2042
02:18:33,772 --> 02:18:35,148
But, my daughter is in there...
- You can't go in.

2043
02:18:35,206 --> 02:18:36,549
My daughter is in there.
- Wait.

2044
02:18:38,877 --> 02:18:40,823
Did he come to your house?

2045
02:18:40,879 --> 02:18:42,483
I don't know, uncle.

2046
02:18:42,547 --> 02:18:45,584
I want to go to my parents.

2047
02:18:45,683 --> 02:18:49,894
Be honest then,
I will take you to your parents.

2048
02:18:56,093 --> 02:18:59,631
You better be honest,
or I am going to get upset.

2049
02:18:59,997 --> 02:19:03,069
When I get angry...

2050
02:19:03,635 --> 02:19:05,272
...you know, what I can do.

2051
02:19:06,638 --> 02:19:09,949
Tell me the truth
or I am going to kill you!

2052
02:19:11,308 --> 02:19:14,050
We should tell them the truth.

2053
02:19:15,346 --> 02:19:17,349
Gaitonde is a monster.

2054
02:19:17,816 --> 02:19:21,058
What if something
happens to Anu'?

2055
02:19:21,719 --> 02:19:23,596
I am really scared, now.

2056
02:19:23,754 --> 02:19:25,791
I am going to confess.

2057
02:19:25,889 --> 02:19:27,960
Then, everything will be fine, right'?
- No, Nandini.

2058
02:19:29,761 --> 02:19:31,638
Why did we suffer so much'?

2059
02:19:32,996 --> 02:19:34,772
Why did we take the beatings?

2060
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:37,478
So we could give in'?

2061
02:19:40,104 --> 02:19:43,643
I promised you, none
of you will go to prison.

2062
02:19:45,143 --> 02:19:46,884
I will keep my promise.

2063
02:19:50,013 --> 02:19:51,424
Anu...

2064
02:19:57,388 --> 02:19:59,629
Anu...
- Don't worry about Anu.

2065
02:20:01,825 --> 02:20:03,430
She's a brave girl.

2066
02:20:03,927 --> 02:20:06,602
Tell me, what is the truth'?
- Uncle, I don't know!

2067
02:20:06,664 --> 02:20:09,075
I want to go to my mom and dad!

2068
02:20:09,134 --> 02:20:11,977
Meera, this is it.
Just stop him! Enough is enough!

2069
02:20:12,036 --> 02:20:13,709
What we're doing here is illegal!

2070
02:20:13,805 --> 02:20:16,114
What about my son?
Who is going to look for him?

2071
02:20:16,174 --> 02:20:18,380
We have to look for him
but this is not the way!

2072
02:20:18,542 --> 02:20:19,681
Who does this?

2073
02:20:19,744 --> 02:20:21,586
At least, have mercy on that child.

2074
02:20:22,079 --> 02:20:23,854
What are you doing to her'?

2075
02:20:24,048 --> 02:20:25,493
And what's going 'to happen
after all this?

2076
02:20:25,549 --> 02:20:27,689
Did anyone tell you anything'?

2077
02:20:29,120 --> 02:20:31,031
I tell you after all this,
if we find out that...

2078
02:20:31,088 --> 02:20:34,468
...this family is innocent,
we will really regret it.

2079
02:20:35,793 --> 02:20:39,900
I mean, just consider for a moment,
what if Gaitonde is mistaken?

2080
02:20:41,099 --> 02:20:42,736
Tell me the truth!

2081
02:20:42,800 --> 02:20:45,145
Tell me!
- Gaitonde! No!

2082
02:20:46,137 --> 02:20:48,013
Don't hit me!

2083
02:20:48,105 --> 02:20:50,108
I will tell you.

2084
02:20:55,180 --> 02:20:56,487
<i>Mgrâ€œ!</i>

2085
02:20:57,247 --> 02:20:58,522
<i>Anâ€œ!</i>

2086
02:21:06,191 --> 02:21:07,567
Where are you taking my
daughter?

2087
02:21:07,625 --> 02:21:09,399
Your daughter is taking us.

2088
02:21:09,727 --> 02:21:11,832
Where you buried the boy.

2089
02:21:12,629 --> 02:21:16,134
Your game is up, Vijay Salgaonkar.
All done.

2090
02:21:16,634 --> 02:21:20,274
Now, your next family
trip is going to be in prison.

2091
02:21:21,673 --> 02:21:24,984
Hey, get them all into the jeep.

2092
02:21:55,306 --> 02:21:57,013
Get back!
Come on.

2093
02:21:57,108 --> 02:21:58,644
Come on.

2094
02:21:59,343 --> 02:22:00,379
Come on.

2095
02:22:00,477 --> 02:22:02,479
Alright, let's go.

2096
02:22:03,514 --> 02:22:05,516
Come on, get back.

2097
02:22:05,583 --> 02:22:08,393
Get back.
Come on, Let's go.

2098
02:22:08,819 --> 02:22:10,025
Wait!
- Come on.

2099
02:22:10,087 --> 02:22:11,965
Let us go in.

2100
02:22:12,056 --> 02:22:13,398
He's our son.

2101
02:22:13,458 --> 02:22:15,768
No one is allowed
to meet the accused.

2102
02:22:15,826 --> 02:22:17,966
Accused? What has he done'?

2103
02:22:18,162 --> 02:22:19,504
Wait. You'll find out.

2104
02:22:19,596 --> 02:22:22,635
Ma'am. Gaitonde did this.

2105
02:22:22,734 --> 02:22:25,340
Vijay stood up to him.
Gaitonde wants revenge.

2106
02:22:25,435 --> 02:22:26,938
Uncle, what's going on here?

2107
02:22:27,004 --> 02:22:28,176
We don't know yet.

2108
02:22:28,272 --> 02:22:29,808
They won't even tell
us anything.

2109
02:22:29,873 --> 02:22:31,477
That's my daughter
and son-in-law.

2110
02:22:31,542 --> 02:22:34,046
The police remanded them
without any call, a few days back.

2111
02:22:34,245 --> 02:22:35,690
They were interrogated.

2112
02:22:35,746 --> 02:22:37,420
Inte rrogated?
About what'?

2113
02:22:37,514 --> 02:22:40,689
The lG's son is missing.
It's about him.

2114
02:22:40,885 --> 02:22:41,920
Who are you?

2115
02:22:42,020 --> 02:22:43,590
This is my son.

2116
02:22:43,688 --> 02:22:45,963
We all know Vijay
and his family.

2117
02:22:46,057 --> 02:22:49,129
They are good people.
They are being framed here.

2118
02:22:49,627 --> 02:22:51,731
Gaitonde, the man next
to Mr. Prabhu...

2119
02:22:51,796 --> 02:22:53,274
...has been responsible for this!

2120
02:23:34,371 --> 02:23:35,782
Meera!

2121
02:23:43,414 --> 02:23:44,825
Yo u o Kay?

2122
02:24:05,602 --> 02:24:06,843
<i>Anâ€œ!</i>

2123
02:24:13,477 --> 02:24:15,514
Sorry, dad.
I was scared.

2124
02:24:15,579 --> 02:24:17,582
That's why, I told them.

2125
02:24:18,115 --> 02:24:19,424
That's okay, dear.

2126
02:24:22,420 --> 02:24:23,898
He hit you?

2127
02:24:24,221 --> 02:24:25,530
Yes.

2128
02:24:27,257 --> 02:24:29,135
Don't be scared.
I'm with you.

2129
02:25:40,164 --> 02:25:43,337
Meera. Meera, please.
Please...

2130
02:25:46,003 --> 02:25:48,483
Rajesh, Gaitonde hit us.

2131
02:25:48,539 --> 02:25:49,881
He hit our baby Anu.

2132
02:25:50,441 --> 02:25:53,251
We are innocent and still we
were thrashed in the room.

2133
02:25:53,343 --> 02:25:54,879
Gaitonde did it!

2134
02:25:55,212 --> 02:25:56,657
Wait, Gaitonde!

2135
02:25:56,713 --> 02:25:58,057
What the heck! You...

2136
02:25:58,148 --> 02:25:59,559
He hit my daughter.

2137
02:25:59,617 --> 02:26:01,926
Don't touch him, okay?
- Who are you? Get lost.

2138
02:26:02,019 --> 02:26:04,761
You hit a little girl!
Hit him!

2139
02:26:04,855 --> 02:26:06,563
He hit a little girl!
- Sawant!

2140
02:26:06,623 --> 02:26:07,932
Hit him!

2141
02:26:08,226 --> 02:26:09,671
He hit Anu!
- Ma'am. Sir.

2142
02:26:09,761 --> 02:26:11,569
Hit him!
- Meera, come, lefs go.

2143
02:26:11,995 --> 02:26:14,942
Hit him!
He hit a little girl!

2144
02:26:15,233 --> 02:26:17,007
Don't you dare touch the child.

2145
02:26:17,101 --> 02:26:18,375
Hit him!

2146
02:26:19,003 --> 02:26:20,448
He hit a little girl!

2147
02:26:40,358 --> 02:26:44,602
In <i>'the case oi 'the missing Sam
Deshnnukh, son oi 'the Goa</i> IG...

2148
02:26:44,662 --> 02:26:47,643
...the police has
brutally tortured...

2149
02:26:47,731 --> 02:26:51,009
...Vijay Salgaonkar and
his family despite their innocence.

2150
02:26:51,102 --> 02:26:54,275
There is hostility
all over, against them.

2151
02:26:54,337 --> 02:26:56,340
After 'this incident, 'the Pondolem
police station...

2152
02:26:56,440 --> 02:26:59,182
...Sl Gaitonde has been
suspended.

2153
02:26:59,243 --> 02:27:01,519
Orders have been sent
out for further investigation.

2154
02:27:01,578 --> 02:27:04,082
Senior Pl Prabhu and
the officers on this case...

2155
02:27:04,182 --> 02:27:06,492
...have all been transferred
out at once.

2156
02:27:06,550 --> 02:27:10,431
The DGP has sent IG Meera Deshmukh,
on an indefinite leave.

2157
02:27:10,521 --> 02:27:13,865
In its verdict on a PIL,
the court has decreed...

2158
02:27:13,924 --> 02:27:16,804
mthat if the police...

2159
02:27:16,894 --> 02:27:19,772
mwants to interrogate Vijay
Salgaonkar or his family...

2160
02:27:19,831 --> 02:27:22,072
...they need court orders
to do so.

2161
02:27:25,136 --> 02:27:26,342
Vi] 8y -

2162
02:27:34,545 --> 02:27:36,490
Vijay, don't you think that...

2163
02:27:37,281 --> 02:27:39,625
...their lives are completely
ruined'?

2164
02:27:40,218 --> 02:27:42,254
Anyway, it wasn't her fault.

2165
02:27:44,254 --> 02:27:46,757
She was an IG and a mother.

2166
02:27:47,358 --> 02:27:50,736
I feel as if we did the crime
and she paid for it.

2167
02:27:54,332 --> 02:27:56,436
Ifs good of you
to feel that way.

2168
02:27:58,034 --> 02:27:59,980
But, if it were Anju
instead of Sam...

2169
02:28:00,337 --> 02:28:01,782
...and vice versa...

2170
02:28:03,174 --> 02:28:05,745
...wouldn't IG Meera try
to save her son?

2171
02:28:07,144 --> 02:28:08,555
Of course, she would.

2172
02:28:09,413 --> 02:28:11,324
There's nothing wrong
or right about this.

2173
02:28:14,218 --> 02:28:16,390
A person can't live without
his family.

2174
02:28:17,421 --> 02:28:19,093
He can go to any extent
for his family.

2175
02:28:20,757 --> 02:28:24,728
The world may call him
self sewing or selfish.

2176
02:28:27,431 --> 02:28:29,672
I guess, ifs best to
forget about this.

2177
02:28:31,034 --> 02:28:35,710
Vijay, when did you
get 'the corpse out oi 'the pit?

2178
02:28:36,239 --> 02:28:39,049
After I got back
from disposing Sam's car.

2179
02:28:40,176 --> 02:28:41,679
On Sunday night.

2180
02:28:44,048 --> 02:28:45,424
Where did you bury it'?

2181
02:29:06,370 --> 02:29:08,350
I have kept that secret
safe in my heart.

2182
02:29:09,105 --> 02:29:10,779
That is best for all of us.

2183
02:29:11,475 --> 02:29:13,579
I will take it with me,
when I die.

2184
02:29:18,215 --> 02:29:20,023
Did you hope that Anu...

2185
02:29:20,885 --> 02:29:24,697
...would bear it all without
giving in till the end?

2186
02:29:26,691 --> 02:29:27,897
No.

2187
02:29:29,493 --> 02:29:33,338
I didn't think the three ot you
could keep it together tor so long.

2188
02:29:34,898 --> 02:29:37,174
Anu could have spoken
up earlier.

2189
02:29:38,536 --> 02:29:39,775
Poor Anu.

2190
02:29:43,506 --> 02:29:45,680
You've suffered a lot
because of me.

2191
02:29:46,076 --> 02:29:48,182
Dad, the police is here.

2192
02:29:58,422 --> 02:29:59,559
Why are you here?

2193
02:29:59,622 --> 02:30:00,966
Are you back to harass them'?

2194
02:30:01,157 --> 02:30:02,568
We just want to talk to Vijay.

2195
02:30:02,626 --> 02:30:04,128
Do you have a court order?

2196
02:30:11,002 --> 02:30:13,504
What's up, Vijay?
- It's okay, you leave.

2197
02:30:14,405 --> 02:30:15,884
I'm going to change
and be with you.

2198
02:30:51,775 --> 02:30:53,153
We are not here...

2199
02:30:54,611 --> 02:30:59,493
...as 'the IG, 'the police
or a businessman.

2200
02:31:01,317 --> 02:31:03,093
We are here as parents.

2201
02:31:06,457 --> 02:31:09,130
We had given up hope
of being parents. But then...

2202
02:31:10,528 --> 02:31:12,439
...we suddenly had a son.

2203
02:31:13,730 --> 02:31:14,970
Our only son.

2204
02:31:15,665 --> 02:31:18,806
I guess, that's why we
pampered him so much that...

2205
02:31:21,772 --> 02:31:23,478
...we are regretting it today.

2206
02:31:30,815 --> 02:31:33,386
Vijay, when we thought
about it we realized...

2207
02:31:35,252 --> 02:31:38,563
...whatever our son has
experienced...

2208
02:31:39,290 --> 02:31:40,597
...or not...

2209
02:31:41,791 --> 02:31:43,498
...is perhaps, our own fault.

2210
02:31:44,295 --> 02:31:48,106
We pampered him no end
and ruined him.

2211
02:31:51,769 --> 02:31:53,441
That's why we wanted to
meet you, too.

2212
02:31:55,505 --> 02:31:57,212
Inadvertently...

2213
02:31:58,041 --> 02:32:00,750
...we have harassed you
and your family a lot.

2214
02:32:02,345 --> 02:32:03,722
Sorry.

2215
02:32:06,350 --> 02:32:07,761
We are sorry.

2216
02:32:09,185 --> 02:32:10,563
We are really sorry.

2217
02:32:14,257 --> 02:32:16,237
We are leaving the country.

2218
02:32:17,327 --> 02:32:20,332
To London. To live with
her brother.

2219
02:32:22,099 --> 02:32:23,941
But, before we leave, Vijay...

2220
02:32:28,272 --> 02:32:30,148
...just tell us...

2221
02:32:30,907 --> 02:32:32,581
...what happened to Sam?

2222
02:32:38,716 --> 02:32:42,789
Whenever there is a call
we think, ifs Sam.

2223
02:32:44,188 --> 02:32:47,601
When the doorbell rings, it feels
like he's there.

2224
02:32:51,461 --> 02:32:53,566
We can't bear the suspense.

2225
02:32:55,099 --> 02:32:56,976
We can't live like this.

2226
02:32:57,700 --> 02:32:59,271
Just tell us, should we...

2227
02:33:03,873 --> 02:33:05,876
...wait for him?

2228
02:33:08,211 --> 02:33:09,486
Or...

2229
02:33:15,051 --> 02:33:16,121
That's all.

2230
02:33:28,966 --> 02:33:30,502
No, Meera.

2231
02:33:31,801 --> 02:33:33,212
Ifs not your fault.

2232
02:33:35,238 --> 02:33:36,718
I can understand.

2233
02:33:39,009 --> 02:33:40,578
Why would you trust us'?

2234
02:33:41,545 --> 02:33:44,150
We are sorry, again.
Sorry.

2235
02:33:44,614 --> 02:33:45,820
Come, lefs go.

2236
02:33:54,058 --> 02:33:55,468
Meera, let's go!

2237
02:33:55,925 --> 02:33:57,405
We are sorry, too.

2238
02:34:02,865 --> 02:34:06,540
I wish, I was as generous as you.

2239
02:34:08,572 --> 02:34:10,847
But, I am merely a fourth
grade dropout.

2240
02:34:12,209 --> 02:34:13,688
I have a wife.

2241
02:34:14,310 --> 02:34:15,688
I have two daughters.

2242
02:34:16,046 --> 02:34:17,353
And that's the extent of my world.

2243
02:34:17,815 --> 02:34:19,987
I have never thought
beyond that.

2244
02:34:21,218 --> 02:34:22,788
One day, my world...

2245
02:34:23,520 --> 02:34:25,522
...saw an unwanted guest enter.

2246
02:34:25,855 --> 02:34:27,596
He wanted to...

2247
02:34:28,859 --> 02:34:30,496
mdisrupt our world.

2248
02:34:33,997 --> 02:34:36,000
We tried to stop him.

2249
02:34:36,399 --> 02:34:37,777
We begged him.

2250
02:34:39,836 --> 02:34:41,316
But, he didn't listen.

2251
02:34:43,773 --> 02:34:45,048
Then, somehow...

2252
02:34:46,377 --> 02:34:47,822
...a tragedy occurs.

2253
02:34:52,483 --> 02:34:55,861
We send the unwanted guest...

2254
02:34:57,421 --> 02:35:00,402
...to a place, from where
there is no coming back.

2255
02:35:20,176 --> 02:35:22,986
We have given you the
greatest anguish in the world.

2256
02:35:26,516 --> 02:35:28,690
I tried to say sorry
many times.

2257
02:35:30,186 --> 02:35:31,927
I did so, in my heart.

2258
02:35:33,691 --> 02:35:35,397
What else could we do?

2259
02:35:36,760 --> 02:35:39,069
My family is most important
to me.

2260
02:35:40,897 --> 02:35:42,502
I could do anything for them.

2261
02:35:43,299 --> 02:35:44,710
I could go to any extent.

2262
02:35:46,370 --> 02:35:50,784
At that moment, I lose
sight of right or wrong.

2263
02:35:57,715 --> 02:35:59,058
We are sorry.

2264
02:36:47,831 --> 02:36:50,310
Listen to me.
Sir has called you.

2265
02:36:54,304 --> 02:36:56,511
Sir, I'm going to keep
my bags in the quarters.

2266
02:36:58,375 --> 02:37:00,980
Sir, this is Vijay Salgaonkar.

2267
02:37:02,245 --> 02:37:03,520
I know.

2268
02:37:03,746 --> 02:37:05,420
I have seen you on the TV.

2269
02:37:06,216 --> 02:37:08,628
Here you are.
Sign that.

2270
02:37:11,688 --> 02:37:13,634
You must be feeling
really proud.

2271
02:37:14,091 --> 02:37:16,002
You have fooled the police
and all that.

2272
02:37:16,959 --> 02:37:18,234
You just wait.

2273
02:37:18,361 --> 02:37:21,740
Once the corpse is found,
then we shall see.

2274
02:37:22,332 --> 02:37:25,370
I am going to be here
for a couple of years.

2275
02:37:26,469 --> 02:37:28,279
I am going to find it.

2276
02:37:29,505 --> 02:37:30,950
No, sir.

2277
02:37:31,475 --> 02:37:33,546
Who am I to fool the police?

2278
02:37:35,412 --> 02:37:37,584
I respect the police.

2279
02:37:38,449 --> 02:37:41,396
I think, the police protects us.
- Right.

2280
02:37:42,786 --> 02:37:44,527
I believe...

2281
02:37:45,189 --> 02:37:47,965
...you and your police station...

2282
02:37:48,859 --> 02:37:50,634
...will always protect us.

2283
02:37:52,462 --> 02:37:53,806
<i>I'll</i> leave, now.

2284
02:38:41,411 --> 02:38:43,754
The slab has been laid at
the police station.

2285
02:38:44,081 --> 02:38:45,992
The flooring will be laid on Monday.
