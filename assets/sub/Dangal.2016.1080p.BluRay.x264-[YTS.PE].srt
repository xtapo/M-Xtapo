1
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:51,876
Has it come on?

2
00:01:52,917 --> 00:01:54,126
No.

3
00:01:55,501 --> 00:01:57,042
Now?

4
00:01:57,876 --> 00:01:59,459
No.

5
00:02:00,751 --> 00:02:01,959
Now?

6
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:04,209
No.

7
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:06,876
Now?

8
00:02:07,876 --> 00:02:10,042
Turn the damn thing properly!

9
00:02:11,876 --> 00:02:14,917
<i>Welcome to the wrestling area
at the Seoul Olympics.</i>

10
00:02:15,084 --> 00:02:16,917
<i>Looking forward to
an exciting match today.</i>

11
00:02:17,001 --> 00:02:18,001
It's come on.

12
00:02:18,084 --> 00:02:19,459
Shall I come down?

13
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:20,667
No.

14
00:02:20,834 --> 00:02:22,376
Stand there holding it.

15
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:29,167
<i>The final match this Olympics...
in the 72-kilo category,</i>

16
00:02:29,334 --> 00:02:32,959
<i>between wrestlers from
Russia and America.</i>

17
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:35,376
<i>It's really sad that,</i>

18
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:38,584
<i>despite wrestling being
such a popular sport in India.</i>

19
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:43,001
<i>Indian wrestlers have
disappointed in the Olympics.</i>

20
00:02:43,376 --> 00:02:45,959
Even our boys
can bring home medals.

21
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,501
But where is the support?

22
00:02:50,084 --> 00:02:52,376
Neither money, nor facilities.

23
00:02:53,042 --> 00:02:55,959
How will our boys win a medal?

24
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,709
If a medal could be won with words,

25
00:03:00,876 --> 00:03:03,251
you would have won
it a long time ago.

26
00:03:07,376 --> 00:03:08,792
Are you new here?

27
00:03:11,626 --> 00:03:13,917
That's what I thought.

28
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:18,001
Try stepping into a
wrestling arena someday,

29
00:03:18,792 --> 00:03:21,084
you'll run for your life
before the match begins.

30
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:25,334
Looks like you have
done it many times.

31
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:28,584
Run for your life.

32
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:33,042
If this were an arena,
then we'd see who would run.

33
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:35,626
Why do we need an arena?

34
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:41,251
<i>Now, the moment
we were all waiting for.</i>

35
00:03:41,376 --> 00:03:43,876
<i>The stage is all set for a big fight.</i>

36
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:46,834
<i>There's palpable excitement in the air.</i>

37
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:49,876
<i>Both the wrestlers are walking,</i>

38
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:51,667
<i>for the fight.</i>

39
00:03:51,917 --> 00:03:53,876
<i>You are absolutely right, Tom.</i>

40
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:57,376
<i>Looks like it's going
to be an interesting bout.</i>

41
00:03:57,792 --> 00:03:59,251
<i>The crowd seems excited.</i>

42
00:04:02,626 --> 00:04:05,709
<i>The wrestlers come face to face.</i>

43
00:04:06,334 --> 00:04:09,876
<i>Let's see how it plays out.</i>

44
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,501
<i>The customary handshake.</i>

45
00:04:12,584 --> 00:04:15,501
<i>The referee's whistle...
and the match begins!</i>

46
00:04:23,251 --> 00:04:24,751
<i>He's down!</i>

47
00:04:24,834 --> 00:04:26,042
<i>He's down!</i>

48
00:04:26,251 --> 00:04:29,292
<i>An early thrashing
for the Russian wrestler.</i>

49
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:33,042
<i>Overconfidence can often
prove fatal.</i>

50
00:04:33,542 --> 00:04:37,209
Bro, you want to try once more?

51
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:48,792
<i>Now, the wrestlers are gearing up
for the next round.</i>

52
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:55,126
<i>Yes, Tom, this match doesn't look
as easy as it had seemed.</i>

53
00:04:55,917 --> 00:04:57,834
<i>Let's see what happens now.</i>

54
00:04:59,084 --> 00:05:01,751
<i>Both wrestlers testing each other.</i>

55
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:04,417
<i>A great attack!
An equally superb defense.</i>

56
00:05:07,042 --> 00:05:09,584
<i>And that was a magnificent move!</i>

57
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:12,626
<i>What an amazing move!</i>

58
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:15,209
<i>He didn't know what hit him.</i>

59
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:19,292
Here's an attack.

60
00:05:19,834 --> 00:05:21,792
<i>And that's a counter-attack!</i>

61
00:05:22,876 --> 00:05:24,167
<i>And it's over!</i>

62
00:05:24,417 --> 00:05:25,792
<i>It's all over.</i>

63
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:28,084
<i>David has become Goliath,</i>

64
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:30,459
<i>and Goliath has become David here.</i>

65
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,959
<i>Well said, Torn.</i>

66
00:05:32,084 --> 00:05:36,501
<i>No one expected such a quick defeat
for the Russian wrestler.</i>

67
00:05:36,584 --> 00:05:37,667
<i>What a match!</i>

68
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:39,709
<i>This is top class wrestling.</i>

69
00:05:42,334 --> 00:05:43,876
You are good.

70
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:47,084
You've just defeated
a state level champion.

71
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,626
Don't be disheartened buddy,

72
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:53,001
you've just lost to
a national level champion.

73
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,542
<i>Meet my uncle.</i>

74
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:06,834
<i>Mahavir Singh Phogat.</i>

There you go!

106
00:08:03,292 --> 00:08:06,542
Merely building a good body
does not make a wrestler.

107
00:08:06,792 --> 00:08:08,126
Come here, kid.

108
00:08:09,584 --> 00:08:13,126
Wrestling runs in the blood,
you have to be born with it.

109
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:16,042
Here. Buy yourself some milk.

110
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:18,042
Bless you.

111
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:57,751
When there's no food on your plate
what will you eat? Medals?

112
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:01,876
No one gives a damn
about wrestling.

113
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:05,584
Just take up the job
you are being offered.

114
00:09:11,876 --> 00:09:14,584
Why did you quit wrestling?

115
00:09:15,584 --> 00:09:17,792
I had no choice.

116
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,459
Wrestling gave me respect, fame,

117
00:09:23,917 --> 00:09:25,376
but it couldn't give me money.

118
00:09:27,126 --> 00:09:28,251
So, I took up this job.

119
00:09:28,626 --> 00:09:31,959
<i>Every wrestler dreams,</i>

120
00:09:32,084 --> 00:09:34,417
<i>of bringing honor and
glory to the country.</i>

121
00:09:36,501 --> 00:09:39,209
<i>But if the country offers no support,</i>

122
00:09:39,292 --> 00:09:41,917
<i>how far can a wrestler go?</i>

123
00:09:55,209 --> 00:10:00,751
It's not your fault that you
couldn't win a medal for your country.

124
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:05,501
How long will you let these
memories depress you?

125
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:15,959
What I couldn't do,
our son will.

126
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:21,084
He will win gold
for our country.

127
00:10:23,292 --> 00:10:25,876
Our flag will fly the highest.

128
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,251
Mark my words.

129
00:10:34,542 --> 00:10:37,459
<i>That day uncle was
as anxious as a student,</i>

130
00:10:37,542 --> 00:10:39,959
<i>whose high school results
were due.</i>

131
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:42,167
Don't worry, brother.

132
00:10:42,251 --> 00:10:43,376
It's going to be alright.

133
00:10:55,376 --> 00:10:56,876
It's a girl.

134
00:11:03,876 --> 00:11:06,584
<i>Uncle was hoping for a boy.</i>

135
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:08,292
<i>But a girl was born.</i>

136
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,501
It's okay.

137
00:11:11,501 --> 00:11:13,959
You have a sister now, Omkar.

138
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:16,459
<i>I was genuinely happy.</i>

139
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:19,417
<i>But uncle was faking it.</i>

140
00:11:21,084 --> 00:11:22,917
<i>And then it all started.</i>

141
00:11:23,292 --> 00:11:26,251
<i>Suddenly everyone in the village
was an expert,</i>

142
00:11:26,334 --> 00:11:30,542
<i>in the art of conceiving a boy.</i>

143
00:11:31,417 --> 00:11:34,542
Feed a black cow sweets made
with white sesame seeds,

144
00:11:34,626 --> 00:11:37,542
wrapped in maize flatbreads,
with your left hand, before sunrise.

145
00:11:37,626 --> 00:11:38,876
A son, for sure!

146
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,376
Mahavir, here's a special prayer...
for a son.

147
00:11:42,792 --> 00:11:45,334
Recite it daily.

148
00:11:47,167 --> 00:11:48,917
Here... eat this.

149
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,751
Eat this!

150
00:11:51,334 --> 00:11:52,542
Stop, will you.

151
00:11:55,042 --> 00:11:56,126
Mahavir,

152
00:11:56,334 --> 00:11:58,751
make sure you try only on a Sunday.

153
00:11:59,584 --> 00:12:03,334
On all other days,
reign in your urges.

154
00:12:04,876 --> 00:12:06,251
Got it?

155
00:12:07,334 --> 00:12:09,126
<i>Neither did people stop
giving their advice,</i>

156
00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:10,667
Here you go, son.

157
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:13,042
<i>Nor did uncle and aunt
stop acting on them.</i>

158
00:12:13,792 --> 00:12:17,376
<i>The day of the delivery arrived
and so did half the village.</i>

159
00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:19,542
<i>To take credit for a son.</i>

160
00:12:19,626 --> 00:12:21,751
Geeta, you are going to
have a brother.

161
00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:23,042
You can play with him.

162
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,459
It's a girl.

163
00:12:35,292 --> 00:12:37,501
<i>But neither did uncle get a son,</i>

164
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:40,001
<i>nor the villagers, credit.</i>

165
00:12:40,876 --> 00:12:43,084
<i>But, in all these
"unfailing techniques",</i>

166
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:45,001
<i>where did the fault lie?</i>

167
00:12:47,292 --> 00:12:49,876
She must have fed a black buffalo
instead of a black cow.

168
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:52,501
Else, look at my cousin
from Rohtak.

169
00:12:52,584 --> 00:12:54,501
She had three healthy boys
in three years.

170
00:12:54,584 --> 00:12:56,959
If you say the prayer in reverse,

171
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:59,959
the results will also be reversed.

172
00:13:00,042 --> 00:13:02,376
Self-control is a virtue.

173
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:06,501
I told him to try only on Sundays.

174
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:10,334
He must have let
the reins free every day.

175
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,709
I couldn't give you a son...

176
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:22,542
It's not your fault.

177
00:13:24,334 --> 00:13:25,834
And don't get me wrong.

178
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:30,834
Both, Geeta and Babita
are very dear to me.

179
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:38,959
But only a boy
can fulfill my dream.

180
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,459
<i>Years went by.</i>

181
00:13:57,959 --> 00:13:59,876
<i>Uncle remained adamant,</i>

182
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:01,626
<i>he wanted a boy.</i>

183
00:14:05,126 --> 00:14:07,959
<i>But maybe God was adamant too.</i>

184
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:10,042
<i>The third child was a girl,</i>

185
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:13,542
<i>and so was the fourth.</i>

186
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:26,042
<i>This time I too was dejected.</i>

187
00:14:41,584 --> 00:14:44,459
Food is ready, papa.

188
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:02,292
Turn it over or it'll burn.

189
00:15:13,084 --> 00:15:20,334
<i>After that uncle gave up on his
desire for a son, and on his dream too.</i>

190
00:15:22,626 --> 00:15:24,542
Hey, Mahavir Singh-ji!

191
00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:27,667
What's wrong with him?

192
00:15:30,751 --> 00:15:33,459
Are you coming to watch
the wrestling match this evening?

193
00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:38,209
No. You carry on.

194
00:15:40,876 --> 00:15:41,876
Hey, Mahavir!

195
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:45,459
I've been blessed with a boy.

196
00:15:45,542 --> 00:15:47,209
Here... have some sweets.

197
00:16:33,876 --> 00:16:35,042
What happened?

198
00:16:35,251 --> 00:16:38,459
Look how badly
they've been thrashed.

199
00:16:38,917 --> 00:16:39,709
Say something!

200
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:42,042
Yes, look how badly
they've been thrashed.

201
00:16:42,542 --> 00:16:43,792
They're all swollen and bruised.

202
00:16:43,876 --> 00:16:45,501
Yes, they're all swollen and bruised.

203
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:48,959
Why did you beat them?

204
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:50,251
I didn't, uncle.

205
00:16:50,917 --> 00:16:53,042
Geeta and Babita beat them up.

206
00:17:05,917 --> 00:17:07,834
They started it.

207
00:17:08,001 --> 00:17:10,667
He called me a loser
and Babita a witch.

208
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:12,626
So, we gave it to them.

209
00:17:13,001 --> 00:17:16,376
They beat them so badly?
For such a trivial reason?

210
00:17:18,251 --> 00:17:20,626
Yes, shouldn't have
beaten them so badly.

211
00:17:21,876 --> 00:17:23,667
Please forgive them...
they're kids.

212
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:28,251
We are letting go because
they are your girls.

213
00:17:29,084 --> 00:17:30,167
Move!

214
00:17:30,251 --> 00:17:32,084
Got thrashed by girls!

215
00:17:37,209 --> 00:17:38,376
Come here.

216
00:17:40,876 --> 00:17:41,667
Come here!

217
00:17:45,751 --> 00:17:48,459
We won't fight again, papa.

218
00:17:49,126 --> 00:17:52,126
First tell me, how did you
manage to do it?

219
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:58,376
First, he called me a loser
but I remained quiet.

220
00:17:58,459 --> 00:18:00,626
But then he called Babita a witch.

221
00:18:00,709 --> 00:18:01,292
That was it.

222
00:18:01,376 --> 00:18:04,042
I grabbed him and
punched him like this.

223
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,209
Then the other guy attacked.

224
00:18:07,292 --> 00:18:09,751
I caught his hair
and shoved him down,

225
00:18:09,834 --> 00:18:12,084
and dug my elbow in his back.

226
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:34,959
<i>They say that a twig is enough
to give hope to a drowning man.</i>

227
00:18:35,292 --> 00:18:38,334
<i>Here, uncle had found
not one, but two lifeguards!</i>

228
00:18:50,376 --> 00:18:53,167
All along, I was desperate for a son,

229
00:18:53,251 --> 00:18:56,292
so he could win a gold
for the country.

230
00:18:58,584 --> 00:19:02,959
But what didn't occur to me
is that gold is gold.

231
00:19:03,501 --> 00:19:05,876
Whether a boy wins it, or a girl.

232
00:19:07,501 --> 00:19:11,501
From now on, Geeta and Babita
will do no household chores.

233
00:19:13,084 --> 00:19:16,417
Wrestling is in their blood.

234
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:19,751
From now on they will only wrestle.

235
00:19:21,709 --> 00:19:24,251
Wrestling is for boys.

236
00:19:24,626 --> 00:19:26,542
You think our girls are
any lesser than boys?

237
00:19:26,626 --> 00:19:29,667
I've never ever seen girls wrestle.

238
00:19:32,167 --> 00:19:34,251
What will the villagers say?

239
00:19:34,751 --> 00:19:37,001
For how long will they talk?

240
00:19:39,417 --> 00:19:42,334
What if the girls break
their hands and legs?

241
00:19:43,376 --> 00:19:45,209
We'll fix them.

242
00:19:47,459 --> 00:19:49,792
Where will the money come from?

243
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:52,459
I don't know.

244
00:19:56,042 --> 00:20:00,084
Don't ruin the girls' lives
for your passion.

245
00:20:04,584 --> 00:20:07,126
Let me try for a year.

246
00:20:08,084 --> 00:20:10,751
For this one year,
you bury your feelings.

247
00:20:13,542 --> 00:20:15,959
If I'm proven wrong,

248
00:20:16,209 --> 00:20:18,917
I'll bury my dream forever.

249
00:20:31,292 --> 00:20:33,209
Be ready at 5 a.m. tomorrow.

250
00:20:36,251 --> 00:20:37,417
Why, papa?

251
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:45,167
I want to feed you
your favourite snack, 'gol gappas'.

252
00:20:48,626 --> 00:20:49,709
5 a.m. Okay?

253
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,959
What did you do now?

254
00:20:55,084 --> 00:20:56,834
I thought you did something.

255
00:21:02,126 --> 00:21:03,126
Eat.

256
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:08,626
How is it?

257
00:21:09,376 --> 00:21:11,334
It's a little less spicy, papa.

258
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:13,584
Alright, make it spicier.

259
00:21:18,042 --> 00:21:19,959
Eat as much as you want right now.

260
00:21:21,542 --> 00:21:26,042
Because from today, you will both
lead the life of a wrestler.

261
00:21:30,626 --> 00:21:33,959
And wrestlers are not allowed,

262
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:36,459
pickled, oily and spicy food,

263
00:21:37,001 --> 00:21:39,959
in fact,
all the food that you most love.

264
00:21:43,834 --> 00:21:45,959

punished so severely,

293
00:23:50,501 --> 00:23:53,459
for beating up a couple of boys.

294
00:23:54,209 --> 00:23:59,417

00:25:31,584 --> 00:25:33,542
Just save us
from this wrestling.

321
00:25:33,626 --> 00:25:36,376
For one year forget
that you have a mother.

322
00:25:38,042 --> 00:25:40,126
Hey! Forgot so quickly?

323
00:25:41,626 --> 00:25:43,667
How utterly absurd, Mahavir!

324
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:45,209
Girls in the wrestling arena?

325
00:25:45,376 --> 00:25:47,959
Will you have me sin at this age?

326
00:25:50,709 --> 00:25:52,917
<i>♪ Our childhood has been
thrown away, ♪</i>

327

336
00:26:31,667 --> 00:26:33,376
Babita...

337
00:26:37,417 --> 00:26:40,542
Will you press my legs please?

338
00:26:40,917 --> 00:26:44,584
I was going to ask you
the same thing.

339
00:27:22,584 --> 00:27:25,334
Always respect Mother Earth.

340
00:27:26,251 --> 00:27:28,834
The more you respect it,

341
00:27:29,084 --> 00:27:31,251
the more respect
you will get in return.

342
00:27:58,376 --> 00:28:01,834
<i>Uncle had managed to bring
Geeta and Babita to the wrestling pit,</i>

343
00:28:02,042 --> 00:28:03,792
<i>but there was something missing.</i>

344
00:28:04,001 --> 00:28:07,042
<i>In order for Geeta and
Babita to train well,</i>

345
00:28:07,292 --> 00:28:09,667
<i>they needed to practice
with good wrestlers.</i>

346
00:28:13,542 --> 00:28:14,709
Omkar?

347
00:28:15,542 --> 00:28:16,584
Him?

348
00:28:17,751 --> 00:28:18,459
Yes.

349
00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:20,959
Isn't that too much, brother?

350
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:23,917
It was bad enough that
you were making the girls wrestle.

351
00:28:24,167 --> 00:28:26,417
Now you want them to fight boys?

352
00:28:27,751 --> 00:28:29,876
Yes or no?

353
00:28:32,876 --> 00:28:34,792
I don't have the heart to say yes.

354
00:28:35,876 --> 00:28:37,459
And, I don't have the courage
to say no.

355
00:28:37,667 --> 00:28:39,792
Okay, then send him over.

356
00:28:46,376 --> 00:28:50,459
Because of you both
I'm caught in the crossfire.

357
00:28:50,917 --> 00:28:52,542
Stop complaining!

358
00:28:52,751 --> 00:28:54,876
You are just caught
in the crossfire.

359
00:28:54,959 --> 00:28:57,334
We've been pushed into war.

360
00:28:57,417 --> 00:28:58,376
Keep running!

361
00:28:59,084 --> 00:29:01,834
Why has papa got him
to train with us?

362
00:29:01,917 --> 00:29:03,959
This pint-sized boy is no challenge.

363
00:29:04,084 --> 00:29:06,251
He looks like a 'TTSS' to me.

364
00:29:06,334 --> 00:29:07,417
What does that mean?

365
00:29:07,501 --> 00:29:09,501
Tall on Talk, Short on Strength.

366
00:29:14,292 --> 00:29:16,084
'TTSS'... is it?

367
00:29:32,584 --> 00:29:34,751
Go easy, I'm your little sister.

368
00:29:34,917 --> 00:29:35,792
Yes... yes!

369
00:29:45,584 --> 00:29:47,084
Don't mind me saying,

370
00:29:47,209 --> 00:29:48,709
but your girls are a little weak.

371
00:29:49,209 --> 00:29:51,126
Want to fight me?

372
00:29:51,376 --> 00:29:52,834
I'll be right back.

373
00:30:45,167 --> 00:30:47,334
I don't understand your ways.

374
00:30:53,959 --> 00:31:01,292
At one time, I can either be
their coach or their father.

375
00:31:05,042 --> 00:31:07,126
When the coach is at work,

376
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:10,542
the father has to take a backseat.

377
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:19,459
Sorry for calling you 'TTSS'.

378
00:31:19,542 --> 00:31:20,959
Sorry. My foot!

379
00:31:25,626 --> 00:31:27,542
You think this is a joke?

380
00:31:28,084 --> 00:31:30,876
He is throwing you down
and you are letting him?

381
00:31:31,626 --> 00:31:32,626
When he attacks from the left,

382
00:31:32,709 --> 00:31:35,709
why don't you stabilize yourself
on the left and defend?

383
00:31:36,376 --> 00:31:37,251
Sorry, Papa-

384
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:39,376
Child, this is wrestling,

385
00:31:39,542 --> 00:31:42,042
three sorrys and the game is over.

386
00:31:43,209 --> 00:31:44,001
Come on.

387
00:31:44,209 --> 00:31:45,542
Try again.

388
00:31:53,834 --> 00:31:55,792
Where's the strength in you?

389
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,667
You are training the girls to wrestle,

390
00:32:02,001 --> 00:32:03,667
I didn't say anything.

391
00:32:03,751 --> 00:32:05,876
But I will not allow you to cook
chicken in my kitchen!

392
00:32:05,959 --> 00:32:07,209
Try and understand.

393
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:09,417
Wrestlers require protein.

394
00:32:09,667 --> 00:32:10,792
I don't care!

395
00:32:11,209 --> 00:32:12,959
If meat is cooked in my kitchen,

396
00:32:13,084 --> 00:32:14,376
I will stop eating.

397
00:32:14,459 --> 00:32:16,584
You want your girls
to be weak wrestlers?

398
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:18,167
I don't know anything.

399
00:32:18,251 --> 00:32:20,834
There's no way chicken will be
cooked in my kitchen!

400
00:32:24,209 --> 00:32:25,917
- Omkar!
- Yes.

401
00:32:26,126 --> 00:32:27,626
Do you know how to cook?

402
00:32:27,709 --> 00:32:28,376
No, uncle.

403
00:32:28,459 --> 00:32:29,959
Then learn.

404
00:32:31,167 --> 00:32:33,542
We don't have enough money
for their current diet.

405
00:32:33,626 --> 00:32:35,667
How can we afford chicken now?

406
00:32:35,751 --> 00:32:38,876
What? Sell you chicken
worth 100 rupees for 20?

407
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:40,834
And I will benefit from this deal?

408
00:32:41,792 --> 00:32:44,167
Why don't you explain the math?

409
00:32:45,417 --> 00:32:48,792
Look, Geeta and Babita will eventually
become famous wrestlers.

410
00:32:49,959 --> 00:32:53,167
And when people will find out that
they eat chicken from your shop,

411
00:32:53,251 --> 00:32:55,334
where do you think
they'll buy chicken from?

412
00:32:55,667 --> 00:32:58,001
That makes sense.

413
00:32:58,251 --> 00:32:59,376
But just 20 rupees?

414
00:32:59,584 --> 00:33:00,626
There are other shops too.

415
00:33:00,709 --> 00:33:02,126
Wait... listen.

416
00:33:03,751 --> 00:33:05,542
Let's make it 40.

417
00:33:05,626 --> 00:33:08,126
I won't give a dime
more than 25.

418
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:22,876
I have browned the onions,

419
00:33:23,417 --> 00:33:26,126
and now this pot
will not go back in my kitchen.

420
00:33:39,042 --> 00:33:41,542
Now, put the chicken in the pot.

421
00:33:48,334 --> 00:33:51,167
And let it cook on a slow flame.

422
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:03,459
It's to be eaten with rice.

423
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:07,084
But... it can also be
eaten with bread.

424
00:34:16,792 --> 00:34:18,792
<i>Uncle was fulfilling his duty,</i>

425
00:34:18,959 --> 00:34:20,959
<i>and the villagers, theirs.</i>

426
00:34:21,042 --> 00:34:23,751
Girls are best suited
for the kitchen,

427
00:34:23,834 --> 00:34:24,959
not for wrestling.

428
00:34:25,209 --> 00:34:26,667
Mahavir Singh has gone mad.

429
00:34:26,959 --> 00:34:27,876
Not mad,

430
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:29,209
he's become shameless.

431
00:34:29,292 --> 00:34:33,626
He's getting the girls to
wear shorts and fight boys.

432
00:34:33,876 --> 00:34:37,751
Since you all started wrestling,
your walk has become very manly.

433
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:39,751
Wonder what else will happen?

434
00:34:40,042 --> 00:34:43,626
Next, it'll be my fist
and your face.

435
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:48,626
If only you had
given birth to a boy!

436
00:34:48,876 --> 00:34:51,251
Their mother doesn't protest either.

437
00:34:52,417 --> 00:34:54,751
The entire village is laughing at us.

438
00:34:54,876 --> 00:34:57,417
Who will marry our girls?

439
00:34:58,501 --> 00:35:01,709
I will make our girls so capable,

440
00:35:01,834 --> 00:35:03,834
that boys will not choose them,

441
00:35:03,917 --> 00:35:05,376
they will choose boys!

442
00:35:08,084 --> 00:35:11,417
I'm going to tell papa today,
this wrestling isn't working out.

443
00:35:11,501 --> 00:35:12,751
Me, too.

444
00:35:12,834 --> 00:35:15,584
B-O-Y... boy.

445
00:35:16,876 --> 00:35:19,626
C-A-T... cat.

446
00:35:20,709 --> 00:35:22,959
Papa, this wrestling
isn't working out...

447
00:35:23,751 --> 00:35:24,751
for Babita.

448
00:35:26,751 --> 00:35:28,417
Yes, papa... and,

449
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:32,417
Geeta gets so tired
that she falls asleep in class.

450
00:35:33,084 --> 00:35:36,584
She can't concentrate
on her studies at all.

451
00:35:37,626 --> 00:35:39,792
Babita's body aches terribly.

452
00:35:40,167 --> 00:35:42,501
She keeps tossing
and turning all night.

453
00:35:42,584 --> 00:35:46,792
In school, girls tease
Geeta by calling her a man.

454
00:35:47,167 --> 00:35:48,167
Sad, isn't it?

455
00:35:49,792 --> 00:35:52,376
None of these
seem like a problem.

456
00:35:52,834 --> 00:35:54,834
Tell me if there is
a real problem.

457
00:35:55,209 --> 00:35:55,792
Read.

458
00:35:55,876 --> 00:35:59,834
E-L-E-P-H-A-N-T

459
00:35:59,917 --> 00:36:03,376
Papa, our hair is getting ruined
because of wrestling in the mud.

460
00:36:04,626 --> 00:36:06,167
She even has lice.

461
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:08,792
I killed eight this evening.

462
00:36:13,542 --> 00:36:14,959
Now, that's a real problem.

463
00:36:16,917 --> 00:36:18,959
Okay, be ready tomorrow at 5 a.m.

464
00:36:23,042 --> 00:36:23,876
Papa, please.

465
00:36:24,084 --> 00:36:25,292
We don't have any problem.

466
00:36:25,584 --> 00:36:27,501
In fact, we are enjoying it.

467
00:36:27,626 --> 00:36:29,334
Please don't cut our hair.

468
00:36:29,417 --> 00:36:31,501
We will do as you say.

469
00:36:31,834 --> 00:36:33,084
Ma, say something.

470
00:36:33,167 --> 00:36:34,792
Look what papa is doing.

471
00:36:34,876 --> 00:36:36,459
Please don't cut our hair, papa.

472
00:36:36,542 --> 00:36:38,667
We'll do whatever you say.

473
00:36:38,751 --> 00:36:40,751
We'll wake up in the morning!

474
00:36:40,834 --> 00:36:42,459
Do everything...
won't ever complain.

475
00:36:42,542 --> 00:36:44,459
Just don't cut our hair, please.

476
00:36:44,542 --> 00:36:45,959
Please, papa.

477
00:36:47,542 --> 00:36:48,334
Cut it.

478
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:49,834
Cut it?

479
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,334
Can you grow it?

480
00:36:54,292 --> 00:36:55,167
Then cut it.

481
00:38:21,209 --> 00:38:22,834
Getting them to wrestle
was still okay,

482
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:25,917
but it's cruel to chop their hair off!

483
00:38:26,667 --> 00:38:28,126
They are girls, after all.

484
00:38:28,667 --> 00:38:31,501
Whatever I'm doing
is for their best.

485
00:38:32,459 --> 00:38:35,334
Anything that distracts them
from wrestling,

486
00:38:35,584 --> 00:38:36,667
I will get rid of!

487
00:38:38,667 --> 00:38:41,626
"Is that the full moon or the sun!"

488
00:38:41,709 --> 00:38:44,709
I'm confused... today both
seem to have risen together.

489
00:38:46,417 --> 00:38:47,751
Let it go, Babita.

490
00:38:47,917 --> 00:38:50,251
Our stars are to blame.

491
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:57,126
Enough of wrestling,

492
00:38:58,292 --> 00:38:59,917
now, it's time for a street-fight!

493
00:39:00,167 --> 00:39:04,459
<i>And then, in a small village
of Haryana called Balali,</i>

494
00:39:04,667 --> 00:39:06,792
<i>a grand rebellion began.</i>

495
00:39:07,251 --> 00:39:12,376
<i>Revolutionaries Geeta and Babita
versus dictator Mahavir Singh.</i>

496
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:17,251
<i>All of uncle's arsenal
were neutralized one by one.</i>

497
00:39:18,542 --> 00:39:21,959
<i>The alarm clock was
cleverly misguided.</i>

498
00:39:36,542 --> 00:39:38,542
What happened, papa?

499
00:39:39,417 --> 00:39:41,001
You are late today.

500
00:39:41,459 --> 00:39:42,876
Age is catching up.

501
00:39:43,292 --> 00:39:44,292
No problem.

502
00:39:44,792 --> 00:39:46,584
We've finished today's training.

503
00:39:46,709 --> 00:39:48,167
Come, Babita.

504
00:39:54,209 --> 00:39:57,251
<i>Countless light-bulbs were martyred.</i>

505
00:39:59,126 --> 00:40:01,209
How come the bulb fuses everyday?

506
00:40:01,376 --> 00:40:02,542
Quality... papa,

507
00:40:02,709 --> 00:40:04,001
quality!

508
00:40:04,459 --> 00:40:07,167
<i>Injury was made an ally.</i>

509
00:40:09,001 --> 00:40:13,042
<i>In the battlefield, surrender
was given without a ﬁght.</i>

510
00:40:15,292 --> 00:40:16,126
Should I give it to you?

511
00:40:16,209 --> 00:40:18,626
<i>And uncle, despite having both hands,</i>

512
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:22,042
<i>felt helpless like the armless character
from the film 'Sholay’.</i>

513
00:40:22,126 --> 00:40:23,209
Get out of here!

514
00:40:24,792 --> 00:40:29,042
<i>I couldn't understand how
I had suddenly become so strong.</i>

515
00:40:29,334 --> 00:40:32,334
<i>But uncle understood very well
why Geeta and Babita,</i>

516
00:40:32,417 --> 00:40:34,542
<i>had suddenly become so weak.</i>

517
00:40:35,792 --> 00:40:39,459
<i>Geeta and Babita thought
that they had won the war.</i>

518
00:40:40,001 --> 00:40:41,126
Hey!

519
00:40:42,751 --> 00:40:44,667
Are you going to Sunita's wedding?

520
00:40:45,001 --> 00:40:46,626
M... mummy.

521
00:40:46,792 --> 00:40:48,834
Are you trying to embarrass me?

522
00:40:49,751 --> 00:40:51,376
Choose one.

523
00:40:51,584 --> 00:40:52,834
This one.

524
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:02,209
Let me see.

525
00:41:04,459 --> 00:41:07,459
Finally,
my girls are looking like girls.

526
00:41:11,042 --> 00:41:12,376
Don't tell papa.

527
00:41:13,376 --> 00:41:14,876
Come home before 8 p.m.

- Let it go, brother.

550
00:43:34,001 --> 00:43:35,584
- He is crazy.

551
00:43:49,751 --> 00:43:52,417
We missed training
just for a day.

552
00:43:52,917 --> 00:43:56,167
What was the need to create
such a big scene?

553
00:43:58,584 --> 00:44:01,751
What kind of father forces
his daughters to become wrestlers?

554
00:44:03,126 --> 00:44:05,334
Makes them wake up at 5 a.m. to run.

555
00:44:05,584 --> 00:44:07,542
Works them like slaves.

556
00:44:07,626 --> 00:44:09,251
Makes them fight boys.

557
00:44:09,334 --> 00:44:12,167
And if they protest,
he cuts their hair.

558
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:15,126
May God never give
anyone such a father.

559
00:44:18,334 --> 00:44:20,834
I wish God had given me
such a father.

560
00:44:27,042 --> 00:44:30,542
At least your father
thinks about you.

561
00:44:32,876 --> 00:44:35,042
Otherwise, our reality is,

562
00:44:35,792 --> 00:44:37,667
the moment a girl is born,

563
00:44:37,751 --> 00:44:40,376
teach her to cook and clean,

564
00:44:40,542 --> 00:44:42,876
make her do
all the household chores.

565
00:44:45,001 --> 00:44:47,001
And, once she turns 14,

566
00:44:48,292 --> 00:44:50,167
marry her off.

567
00:44:51,501 --> 00:44:53,417
Get rid of the "burden"!

568
00:44:54,751 --> 00:44:57,334
And hand her over to a man,

569
00:44:58,334 --> 00:45:00,417
whom she has never seen before.

570
00:45:02,084 --> 00:45:04,417
Make her bear children
and raise them.

571
00:45:05,584 --> 00:45:07,167
That's all she's good for.

572
00:45:07,459 --> 00:45:10,917
At least your father
considers you his child.

573
00:45:11,251 --> 00:45:12,959
He is fighting against
the whole world.

574
00:45:13,126 --> 00:45:15,876
He is silently tolerating
their taunts.

575
00:45:16,042 --> 00:45:17,209
Why?

576
00:45:18,876 --> 00:45:21,751
So that the two of you
can have a future... a life.

577
00:45:23,167 --> 00:45:25,584
What is he doing wrong?

578
00:46:32,251 --> 00:46:34,667
<i>♪ I'm here to stay. ♪</i>

579
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:37,292
<i>♪ Beat the best. ♪</i>

580

588
00:47:18,167 --> 00:47:20,292
<i>♪ Wrestle, O Wrestler! ♪</i>

589
00:47:21,292 --> 00:47:24,501
<i>That day, one fact
became clear to me.</i>

590
00:47:24,584 --> 00:47:26,501
<i>Don't know about Geeta and Babita,</i>

591
00:47:26,917 --> 00:47:29,667
<i>but I sure didn't have
wrestling in my blood.</i>

592
00:47:31,667 --> 00:47:33,792
Look at him sulk.

593
00:47:35,251 --> 00:47:36,792
Give him some butter, ma.

594
00:47:36,917 --> 00:47:38,876
He's become so weak.

595
00:47:41,126 --> 00:47:43,459
I lost intentionally to
make you happy.

596
00:47:43,542 --> 00:47:44,834
Get lost... 'TTSS'!

597
00:47:44,917 --> 00:47:46,959
"Lost intentionally..."

598
00:47:47,876 --> 00:47:48,959
Don't worry.

599
00:47:49,126 --> 00:47:50,751
It'll remain between us.

600
00:47:50,834 --> 00:47:52,376
After all, you are family.

601
00:47:52,501 --> 00:47:54,542
Your reputation is ours, too.

602
00:47:54,626 --> 00:47:55,959
Don't get so cocky.

603
00:47:56,084 --> 00:47:56,959
Watch me tomorrow.

604
00:47:57,084 --> 00:47:59,167
You won't be able to tomorrow.

605
00:48:00,292 --> 00:48:03,084
No, uncle. Tomorrow, I will
definitely put up a tough fight.

606
00:48:03,251 --> 00:48:04,709
We are going to Rohtak tomorrow.

607
00:48:05,792 --> 00:48:06,751
For a wrestling competition.

608
00:48:12,209 --> 00:48:15,501
But, I am not ready for
a wrestling competition yet.

609
00:48:15,876 --> 00:48:18,042
Who is talking about you?

610
00:48:24,542 --> 00:48:25,959
She will fight boys?

611
00:48:26,501 --> 00:48:28,417
She won't last
two minutes, uncle.

612
00:48:28,501 --> 00:48:29,584
Why?

613
00:48:29,876 --> 00:48:31,167
Aren't you a boy?

614
00:48:32,292 --> 00:48:33,667
She thrashed you.

615
00:48:42,917 --> 00:48:45,667
<i>I had seen a lot of wrestling
competitions in my life.</i>

616
00:48:46,042 --> 00:48:48,251
<i>But today I was going to
witness a bout,</i>

617
00:48:48,709 --> 00:48:51,292
<i>the likes of which, had never
been seen before in Haryana.</i>

618
00:48:52,626 --> 00:48:54,501
<i>A riot was inevitable.</i>

619
00:48:58,334 --> 00:49:01,459
Mr. Mahavir Singh Phogat...
welcome!

620
00:49:01,542 --> 00:49:04,084
It's an honor that you have come
to watch the competition.

621
00:49:04,251 --> 00:49:05,959
I've got a wrestler with me too.

622
00:49:06,084 --> 00:49:06,959
Name, please.

623
00:49:07,167 --> 00:49:08,959
Geeta Kumari Phogat.

624
00:49:10,751 --> 00:49:11,834
What?

625
00:49:12,042 --> 00:49:14,584
Geeta Kumari Phogat.

626
00:49:18,459 --> 00:49:20,042
You'll make a girl wrestle?

627
00:49:20,209 --> 00:49:21,251
Yes. So?

628
00:49:27,667 --> 00:49:28,459
Write.

629
00:49:30,626 --> 00:49:34,709
Sir, the day I organize
a cooking competition,

630
00:49:34,917 --> 00:49:36,584
that day get Ms. Geeta along.

631
00:49:37,334 --> 00:49:38,917
This is a wrestling competition!

632
00:49:40,917 --> 00:49:43,126
We have come from very far.

633
00:49:43,459 --> 00:49:45,334
We won't return without a fight.

634
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:48,667
Either Geeta will fight,

635
00:49:48,876 --> 00:49:49,834
or you and I.

636
00:49:50,001 --> 00:49:53,084
First, you utter nonsense,
and then you are being stubborn too!

637
00:49:53,167 --> 00:49:54,501
What do you mean?

638
00:49:54,584 --> 00:49:56,126
You want a girl
to wrestle with boys?

639
00:49:56,209 --> 00:49:59,626
You may not be bothered
about your honor, but we are.

640
00:49:59,709 --> 00:50:01,501
I will have your honor
laid out now!

641
00:50:02,501 --> 00:50:04,126
Please... sir.

642
00:50:04,417 --> 00:50:08,042
Please... we really respect you, sir.

643
00:50:08,292 --> 00:50:11,251
But what you ask for,
can't happen.

644
00:50:13,959 --> 00:50:15,584
We can't do this, brother.

645
00:50:28,042 --> 00:50:29,001
Let's go.

646
00:50:30,167 --> 00:50:31,834
How dare he...

647
00:50:34,167 --> 00:50:36,459
You are getting a chance to
play the game,

648
00:50:36,542 --> 00:50:38,584
and you are giving a walkover?

649
00:50:39,792 --> 00:50:40,542
Meaning?

650
00:50:40,626 --> 00:50:43,126
How many years have we been
holding wrestling competitions?

651
00:50:43,542 --> 00:50:44,042
Five.

652
00:50:44,209 --> 00:50:46,501
How many people come to see?

653
00:50:46,667 --> 00:50:48,084
Just a handful.

654
00:50:48,542 --> 00:50:49,084
So?

655
00:50:49,334 --> 00:50:51,084
Dimwit, think about it.

656
00:50:51,292 --> 00:50:54,042
In a town that has never
seen a girl wrestle,

657
00:50:54,251 --> 00:50:57,251
when a girl wrestles a boy,

658
00:50:57,334 --> 00:50:59,501
how many people
will come to watch?

659
00:51:00,459 --> 00:51:02,709
Our competition will go
through the roof!

660
00:51:02,959 --> 00:51:04,667
But what if the girl
breaks her arms or legs?

661
00:51:04,751 --> 00:51:06,459
Let them break.

662
00:51:06,709 --> 00:51:08,792
You bandage
your broken competition.

663
00:51:09,167 --> 00:51:10,834
Even if you charge
two rupees per ticket,

664
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:13,876
your wrestlers will eat
for months.

665
00:51:17,001 --> 00:51:18,751
Mahavir-ji!

666
00:51:20,292 --> 00:51:23,751
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls!

667
00:51:23,834 --> 00:51:29,834
You must have seen a girl
walk on fire, eat a snake.

668
00:51:29,917 --> 00:51:32,917
But today, for the first time
in the history of Rohtak,

669
00:51:33,001 --> 00:51:35,834
see a girl wrestling a boy
in a competition,

670
00:51:35,917 --> 00:51:38,584
in half-an-hour, at Lal Chowk.

671
00:51:38,667 --> 00:51:39,959
Tickets - two rupees.

672
00:51:40,042 --> 00:51:42,042
A wrestling girl for two rupees!

673
00:51:43,626 --> 00:51:44,917
You have to win!

674
00:51:48,042 --> 00:51:51,126
Even if you were to pit
your boys against a lion,

675
00:51:51,209 --> 00:51:53,042
there still wouldn't have been
such a crowd.

676
00:52:00,876 --> 00:52:02,334
What do you think?

677
00:52:02,417 --> 00:52:04,084
How many seconds will she last?

678
00:52:04,334 --> 00:52:05,917
S... s... s...

679
00:52:06,001 --> 00:52:08,626
Mate, by the time you finish
she'll be done and dusted.

680
00:52:11,042 --> 00:52:13,167
Will she fight in trunks like these?

681
00:52:14,709 --> 00:52:15,251
Get lost!

682
00:52:15,334 --> 00:52:17,917
I was just hoping.

683
00:52:19,626 --> 00:52:20,542
Where is she?

684
00:52:22,251 --> 00:52:24,042
She looks hot.

685
00:52:24,126 --> 00:52:26,126
Hope her t-shirt doesn't tear.

686
00:52:26,209 --> 00:52:28,459
I hope it does!

687
00:52:37,792 --> 00:52:39,167
Go, Geeta!

688
00:52:43,042 --> 00:52:45,126
- Her father has lost it!

689
00:52:46,876 --> 00:52:49,042
Do you know
the rules of mud-wrestling?

690
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:52,584
Then choose who you
want to lose to.

691
00:52:58,001 --> 00:52:59,751
Who do you think she'll pick?

692
00:52:59,834 --> 00:53:02,167
Our Scrawny Spider.

693
00:53:03,376 --> 00:53:05,959
He will win for the first time.

694
00:53:18,084 --> 00:53:21,459
Gosh, Jassi will beat her to pulp!

695
00:53:21,542 --> 00:53:24,042
Three of you, out of here.

696
00:53:25,459 --> 00:53:27,959
Your girl has lost it.

697
00:53:28,459 --> 00:53:30,667
There is still time, stop her.

698
00:53:31,126 --> 00:53:33,876
Or she'll go back on a stretcher.

699
00:53:34,751 --> 00:53:38,167
Before you fight a bout
you have to fight fear.

700
00:53:39,542 --> 00:53:41,751
At least, my girl has conquered fear.

701
00:53:41,834 --> 00:53:44,376
Go easy, she's a girl.

702
00:53:44,959 --> 00:53:47,251
Don't make that mistake.

703
00:54:22,209 --> 00:54:24,542
Will you embarrass us?

704
00:54:26,126 --> 00:54:27,792
Geeta, great going!

705
00:55:00,584 --> 00:55:02,001
W... wow!

706
00:55:16,334 --> 00:55:17,584
She's gone.

707
00:55:19,709 --> 00:55:21,751
Wh... wh... what a save!

708
00:55:56,459 --> 00:55:57,584
You fought well.

709
00:55:57,959 --> 00:55:59,209
Excellent!

710
00:55:59,792 --> 00:56:03,584
The committee awards
the winning wrestler, Jassi,

711
00:56:03,667 --> 00:56:06,459
with a cash prize of 20 rupees.

712
00:56:07,251 --> 00:56:10,459
And from our patron, Kartar Singh,

713
00:56:10,542 --> 00:56:14,292
a special prize for
Geeta Kumari of 50 rupees!

714
00:56:23,626 --> 00:56:25,126
Sorry, Papa-

715
00:56:28,084 --> 00:56:29,209
It's okay.

716
00:56:29,584 --> 00:56:30,709
Come on.

717
00:56:37,584 --> 00:56:41,001
You got lucky, or you'd have
gone home on a stretcher.

718
00:56:52,292 --> 00:56:53,251
Papa.

719
00:56:57,542 --> 00:56:59,209
When is the next fight?

<i>Once again people had started
talking about Geeta and Babita.</i>

751
00:59:11,542 --> 00:59:15,751
These two girls come from Balali
and thrash boys.

752
00:59:15,917 --> 00:59:18,251
This fellow lost to a girl.

753
00:59:18,334 --> 00:59:20,126
Why don't you fight her?

754
00:59:20,209 --> 00:59:23,876
<i>But this time the heckles were
replaced with applause!</i>

755
00:59:24,834 --> 00:59:27,417
<i>Some did not want to
wrestle with the girls.</i>

756
00:59:30,126 --> 00:59:33,001
<i>And some didn't allow
them to wrestle.</i>

757
00:59:33,084 --> 00:59:34,542
Please leave!

758
00:59:36,834 --> 00:59:38,709
<i>Geeta and Babita were winning
not just wrestling competitions,</i>

759
00:59:38,792 --> 00:59:40,792
<i>but hearts, too.</i>

760
00:59:54,792 --> 01:00:00,209
14,900... 15,000... 15,150.

761
01:00:02,167 --> 01:00:05,126
You've become a senior wrestler!

762
01:00:06,584 --> 01:00:09,542
By getting selected to the
Haryana state team,

763
01:00:09,626 --> 01:00:11,501
Geeta Kumari has brought fame
not only to our school,

764
01:00:11,584 --> 01:00:12,792
but to the entire district of Bhiwani.

765
01:00:12,959 --> 01:00:14,709
And we are sure that,

766
01:00:14,792 --> 01:00:18,501
she will make our town proud
in the National Sub-Juniors, too.

767
01:00:23,876 --> 01:00:26,667
Leave? For two months?

768
01:00:27,042 --> 01:00:29,084
Is your daughter getting married?

769
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:32,876
I have to prepare
Geeta for the Nationals, sir.

770
01:00:34,959 --> 01:00:37,751
Forget about it.

771
01:00:38,667 --> 01:00:41,542
If she was getting married,
I might have considered.

772
01:00:45,042 --> 01:00:47,959
I don't understand your decisions.

773
01:00:48,167 --> 01:00:50,459
I didn't have a choice.

774
01:00:51,292 --> 01:00:53,251
I couldn't let go of my dream,

775
01:00:53,334 --> 01:00:55,001
so, I let go of the job.

776
01:00:55,709 --> 01:00:57,542
What will you do now?

777
01:00:58,917 --> 01:01:01,751
I'll start farming
on our own plot of land.

778
01:01:02,459 --> 01:01:04,126
It's hard work,

779
01:01:04,209 --> 01:01:06,876
but at least I will be able
to give the girls time.

780
01:01:14,376 --> 01:01:17,167
Titu... put this in the car.

781
01:01:18,834 --> 01:01:20,626
Wait... go...

782
01:01:23,042 --> 01:01:24,876
Yes, Mahavir Singh-ji,
what were you saying?

783
01:01:26,501 --> 01:01:29,292
If I could get some funds,
it would help a lot.

784
01:01:30,376 --> 01:01:32,417
My girl has now reached
the state level.

785
01:01:33,417 --> 01:01:33,876
So...

786
01:01:33,959 --> 01:01:36,167
What is the big deal
in reaching state level?

787
01:01:36,417 --> 01:01:38,334
That too in ladies wrestling?

788
01:01:38,584 --> 01:01:42,084
Your daughter ran alone,
and came first.

789
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:46,042
What do you need the funds for?

790
01:01:49,417 --> 01:01:51,626
Sir, I want to buy a mat
for her to train on.

791
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:54,834
She's playing well.

792
01:01:55,834 --> 01:01:57,084
If you support her today,

793
01:01:57,167 --> 01:01:58,959
then one day, she will
make the nation proud.

794
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:00,709
Look, Mahavir Singh-ji,

795
01:02:01,126 --> 01:02:03,584
we get this much
funding for sports.

796
01:02:04,126 --> 01:02:06,084
Wrestling gets this much.

797
01:02:06,251 --> 01:02:07,584
Keep aside gents wrestling,

798
01:02:07,667 --> 01:02:11,167
then remove coaching, dieting,
traveling, equipment, etc.

799
01:02:11,251 --> 01:02:13,501
All that remains for ladies wrestling
is this much.

800
01:02:14,584 --> 01:02:17,251
And for this much,
you bought me a box of sweets.

801
01:02:19,167 --> 01:02:20,501
But you have our
complete support.

802
01:02:27,334 --> 01:02:29,417
The reason India
doesn't win medals,

803
01:02:30,417 --> 01:02:32,917
is because officers like you
are warming these seats.

804
01:02:33,751 --> 01:02:35,751
Alright. I'll get up.

805
01:02:36,209 --> 01:02:38,459
Titu, serve me lunch.

806
01:02:40,751 --> 01:02:42,917
Mahavir Singh-ji,
care to join me for lunch?

807
01:02:49,626 --> 01:02:52,334
The Federation is a breeding ground
for such termites.

808
01:02:54,251 --> 01:02:56,959
They have ruined sports.

809
01:03:02,251 --> 01:03:05,042
There is no support
for sports persons,

810
01:03:06,459 --> 01:03:09,667
only abuses when you don't win.

811
01:03:10,917 --> 01:03:14,042
Medalists don't grow on trees.

812
01:03:14,417 --> 01:03:16,667
You have to nurture them.

813
01:03:17,417 --> 01:03:20,334
With love, with hard work,
with passion.

814
01:03:24,417 --> 01:03:27,626
And here, the scoundrels don't
give money for even a mat.

815
01:03:29,626 --> 01:03:31,584
What is a mat, brother?

816
01:03:31,792 --> 01:03:35,459
Synthetic mattresses
on which wrestlers fight.

817
01:03:37,042 --> 01:03:40,167
A mattress is a mattress!

818
01:03:42,667 --> 01:03:43,834
No?

819
01:03:45,001 --> 01:03:46,417
Did I say something wrong?

820
01:03:56,334 --> 01:03:59,376
<i>Uncle had already ruined
our sleep, figuratively speaking.</i>

821
01:03:59,584 --> 01:04:03,167
<i>Now he was hell bent
on doing it literally, too.</i>

822
01:04:17,459 --> 01:04:20,959
Wrestling on a mat is different
from mud-wrestling.

823
01:04:21,292 --> 01:04:23,417
Now we have to wrestle
on the mat.

824
01:04:23,501 --> 01:04:26,334
And in mat-wrestling
you have to score points.

825
01:04:26,626 --> 01:04:31,709
You can score one, two,
three or five points.

826
01:04:32,626 --> 01:04:33,834
Omkar...

827
01:04:37,917 --> 01:04:40,209
If you hold the opponent
by the waist,

828
01:04:40,417 --> 01:04:42,292
and drop him to his knees,

829
01:04:42,542 --> 01:04:44,667
then you score one point.

830
01:04:44,751 --> 01:04:49,042
And from the ground position
if you roll him on to his back,

831
01:04:49,334 --> 01:04:50,792
then you score two points.

832
01:04:51,001 --> 01:04:52,584
There are different ways
to do this.

833
01:04:52,959 --> 01:04:53,917
Uncle!

834
01:04:54,001 --> 01:04:55,917
Like this.

835
01:04:56,792 --> 01:05:00,251
Or from the ground position,
like this!

836
01:05:02,917 --> 01:05:09,084
If you flip your opponent on his back
from a standing position,

837
01:05:09,292 --> 01:05:11,542
then you will score three points.

838
01:05:12,751 --> 01:05:14,209
Please, uncle!

839
01:05:14,376 --> 01:05:16,001
Like this... three points.

840
01:05:16,084 --> 01:05:19,459
Like this... from standing position...
on to his back.

841
01:05:19,542 --> 01:05:23,667
To score five points is difficult,
but it can be done.

842
01:05:24,334 --> 01:05:26,751
If you flip your opponent
from a standing position,

843
01:05:27,084 --> 01:05:29,917
above your head
in a rainbow-like arc,

844
01:05:30,001 --> 01:05:31,584
and have him fall on his back,

845
01:05:31,667 --> 01:05:33,584
then you score five points!

846
01:05:33,751 --> 01:05:34,501
Watch.

847
01:05:34,584 --> 01:05:35,334
No... no, please, uncle!

848
01:05:35,417 --> 01:05:37,042
- Come here.
- No, please.

849
01:05:41,584 --> 01:05:43,292
A real wrestling mat is not like this.

850
01:05:45,501 --> 01:05:47,126
It's like this.

851
01:06:04,251 --> 01:06:07,042
<i>We have to fight
in the yellow area.</i>

852
01:06:15,417 --> 01:06:18,042
<i>The red zone is a danger area.</i>

853
01:06:19,167 --> 01:06:22,542
<i>If you step out of it,
you lose a point.</i>

854
01:06:29,751 --> 01:06:33,084
<i>There are three rounds
of two minutes each.</i>

855
01:06:33,626 --> 01:06:36,542
<i>Three rounds
of two minutes each.</i>

856
01:06:37,751 --> 01:06:41,959
<i>Whoever wins two out of
three rounds, wins the match.</i>

857
01:06:46,959 --> 01:06:49,751
Sir, your daughter is underweight.

858
01:06:50,542 --> 01:06:51,459
So?

859
01:06:51,626 --> 01:06:52,959
Take my advice.
Go back.

860
01:06:53,251 --> 01:06:55,292
Feed her,

861
01:06:55,542 --> 01:06:57,959
fatten her and
come back next year.

862
01:06:58,417 --> 01:07:01,376
If she fights like this,
she will break her bones.

863
01:07:02,209 --> 01:07:05,001
You just tell me whether
she is allowed to wrestle or not.

864
01:07:06,042 --> 01:07:08,459
Yes... she is.

865
01:07:08,709 --> 01:07:10,251
Sign up.

866
01:07:13,209 --> 01:07:16,751
"Sub-Junior Nationals."

867
01:07:19,709 --> 01:07:20,459
Good move!

868
01:07:34,251 --> 01:07:37,167
<i>Geeta had defeated beefy boys,</i>

869
01:07:37,459 --> 01:07:40,167
<i>how long could these girls survive?</i>

870
01:07:43,251 --> 01:07:44,626
Is that a girl or a storm?

871
01:07:51,417 --> 01:07:55,917
"Sub-Junior National Champion."

872
01:07:56,459 --> 01:07:58,376
"Junior Nationals"

873
01:07:58,542 --> 01:07:59,542
ls she underweight?

874
01:07:59,751 --> 01:08:02,626
Yes... but how does it matter?

875
01:08:26,251 --> 01:08:32,667
"Junior National Champion."

876
01:08:46,917 --> 01:08:50,334
<i>Time flew by.</i>

877
01:08:52,501 --> 01:08:54,834
<i>Geeta went from junior to senior.</i>

878
01:08:56,751 --> 01:08:57,667
<i>And uncle,</i>

879
01:08:57,959 --> 01:09:00,626
<i>from senior to senior-citizen.</i>

880
01:09:04,459 --> 01:09:05,917
Go... Geeta!

881
01:09:07,834 --> 01:09:11,584
<i>Babita and I, went from
shorts to full length pants!</i>

882
01:09:35,626 --> 01:09:37,667
Push... push her down!

883
01:09:40,459 --> 01:09:42,084
Side throw!

884
01:09:55,917 --> 01:09:58,417
Victory to Haryana!

885
01:10:20,584 --> 01:10:22,292
"National Champion."

886
01:10:41,126 --> 01:10:43,584
Finally uncle's dream
has been achieved.

887
01:10:43,792 --> 01:10:46,584
Now we can all relax.

888
01:10:46,876 --> 01:10:47,501
No.

889
01:10:49,709 --> 01:10:51,334
My dream remains to be fulfilled.

890
01:10:53,042 --> 01:10:56,626
Every year sees
a National champion.

891
01:10:56,959 --> 01:10:59,709
My dream will be fulfilled,

892
01:10:59,792 --> 01:11:01,792
when you win gold,
not for yourself,

893
01:11:02,126 --> 01:11:04,209
but for your country.

894
01:11:08,167 --> 01:11:10,334
You can celebrate today.

895
01:11:10,417 --> 01:11:13,584
From tomorrow we start
preparing further.

896
01:11:19,251 --> 01:11:20,626
Papa...

897
01:11:23,751 --> 01:11:25,959
Need to speak to you.

898
01:11:26,542 --> 01:11:27,751
Tell me.

899
01:11:28,167 --> 01:11:29,459
Papa.

900
01:11:29,959 --> 01:11:34,126
Now that I am a
National champion, so...

901
01:11:35,542 --> 01:11:36,417
So?

902
01:11:36,501 --> 01:11:37,876
No, I mean,

903
01:11:37,959 --> 01:11:42,417
all National champions
need to go to Patiala,

904
01:11:42,501 --> 01:11:44,126
for further training.

905
01:11:44,542 --> 01:11:46,001
To the National Sports Academy.

906
01:11:46,084 --> 01:11:47,542
What are you getting at?

907
01:11:47,626 --> 01:11:49,126
Tell me clearly.

908
01:11:49,959 --> 01:11:52,334
I will have to go too, papa.

909
01:11:53,501 --> 01:11:56,959
From now, I'll have to train there,

910
01:11:59,042 --> 01:12:01,542
under the national coach.

911
01:12:15,792 --> 01:12:17,334
Geeta Kumari Phogat.

912
01:12:17,417 --> 01:12:18,959
Wrestling.

913
01:12:37,501 --> 01:12:39,292
The place looks good.

914
01:12:41,417 --> 01:12:42,834
Let's hope the coach is good too.

915
01:12:48,001 --> 01:12:49,917
Girls, come on.

916
01:12:54,751 --> 01:12:57,417
You all must be rejoicing,

917
01:12:57,501 --> 01:13:00,334
at the thought of
advanced training.

918
01:13:02,959 --> 01:13:04,501
Well, forget about learning,

919
01:13:04,917 --> 01:13:06,376
first you have to learn to forget!

920
01:13:07,376 --> 01:13:09,501
Forget the wrong training
you've received.

921
01:13:09,834 --> 01:13:11,959
Wrong diet, wrong exercise,
wrong technique.

922
01:13:12,167 --> 01:13:14,834
And after forgetting all that,

923
01:13:14,917 --> 01:13:16,792
your real training will begin,

924
01:13:16,959 --> 01:13:19,501
with National Coach,
Pramod Kadam.

925
01:13:20,459 --> 01:13:24,376
And you will only learn
what I teach you.

926
01:13:25,751 --> 01:13:27,626
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir!

927
01:13:27,709 --> 01:13:30,334
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir!

928
01:13:30,417 --> 01:13:31,501
Good.

929
01:13:32,209 --> 01:13:32,959
Warm up.

930
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:34,584
Get me tea!

931
01:13:37,792 --> 01:13:38,876
Come on, girls.

932
01:13:38,959 --> 01:13:41,792
Energy... more energy!

933
01:13:42,042 --> 01:13:43,709
Yes, that's the way.

934
01:13:43,792 --> 01:13:44,626
Keep it up!

935
01:13:45,626 --> 01:13:46,209
Good.

936
01:13:46,292 --> 01:13:47,626
Namaste, sir.

937
01:13:48,501 --> 01:13:50,667
Sir, I'm Mahavir Singh Phogat.

938
01:13:50,834 --> 01:13:52,417
Geeta's father.

939
01:13:53,584 --> 01:13:54,251
Okay.

940
01:13:54,542 --> 01:13:56,459
I'm the one who has trained her.

941
01:13:56,626 --> 01:13:58,792
Yes... good.

942
01:14:00,667 --> 01:14:01,626
She's good.

943
01:14:01,709 --> 01:14:04,542
Very strong, with a lot of stamina.

944
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:09,834
Where's my tea?

945
01:14:11,459 --> 01:14:12,917
Come on... move it!

946
01:14:20,667 --> 01:14:21,917
Sir... one request.

947
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:25,959
If Geeta gets the right coaching,

948
01:14:26,126 --> 01:14:28,542
she will definitely win
an international medal.

949
01:14:30,709 --> 01:14:31,751
Geeta!

950
01:14:34,417 --> 01:14:38,542
There should be a 90 degree
angle between your calf and thigh.

951
01:14:38,917 --> 01:14:40,959
Who has taught you?

952
01:14:42,667 --> 01:14:44,959
Is this how you will win
an international medal?

953
01:14:49,834 --> 01:14:52,209
You came to drop her, right?

954
01:14:52,542 --> 01:14:54,084
You've done that.

955
01:14:55,542 --> 01:14:56,959
Now leave the rest to me.

956
01:14:58,876 --> 01:15:00,501
Don't waste my time!

957
01:15:39,126 --> 01:15:40,334
Is Geeta happy?

958
01:15:43,167 --> 01:15:45,667
The institute must be
very big, isn't it?

959
01:15:48,501 --> 01:15:51,417
Everyone there must be
a champion, isn't it?

960
01:15:53,209 --> 01:15:54,834
And the facilities there
must be amazing, right?

961
01:15:55,042 --> 01:15:56,167
Have you trained today?

962
01:15:56,376 --> 01:15:58,459
Yes. And the coach
must be top notch?

963
01:15:58,709 --> 01:16:00,417
You seem very eager to go there.

964
01:16:02,917 --> 01:16:04,751
Remember, I'm still your coach.

965
01:16:07,209 --> 01:16:09,042
Your first time away from home?

966
01:16:10,709 --> 01:16:14,042
Just you wait...
we'll have a blast.

967
01:16:15,917 --> 01:16:18,292
Girls, 'DDLJ' is showing on TV.

968
01:16:18,584 --> 01:16:19,334
WOW!

969
01:16:19,876 --> 01:16:21,251
Let's watch.

970
01:16:21,459 --> 01:16:22,626
I'm going to sleep.

971
01:16:22,709 --> 01:16:25,167
You can't say no
to Shah Rukh Khan.

972
01:16:25,459 --> 01:16:26,792
It's a sin.

973
01:16:26,959 --> 01:16:27,626
Come.

974
01:16:31,376 --> 01:16:36,209
"Raj, if this girl loves you,
she will turn to look at you."

975
01:16:37,209 --> 01:16:38,042
Please turn.

976
01:16:40,042 --> 01:16:41,042
"Turn.

977
01:16:41,459 --> 01:16:42,417
Turn.

978
01:16:45,834 --> 01:16:46,917
Turn.

979
01:16:47,792 --> 01:16:48,751
"Turn.

980
01:16:49,667 --> 01:16:52,167
She turned!

981
01:17:03,876 --> 01:17:07,459
Just grow your hair.
You will kill it.

982
01:17:08,167 --> 01:17:09,792
A rhino uses strength,

983
01:17:09,959 --> 01:17:13,126
but the tiger uses both
strength and technique.

984
01:17:13,459 --> 01:17:15,542
Be a tiger, not a rhino.

985
01:17:15,751 --> 01:17:16,542

Geeta!

1028
01:19:38,501 --> 01:19:39,501
Come here.

1029
01:19:41,751 --> 01:19:43,917
Forget your papa's technique.

1030
01:19:44,167 --> 01:19:46,209
Learn only what I teach you.

1031
01:19:46,292 --> 01:19:47,084
Got that?

1032
01:19:48,876 --> 01:19:49,584
Hello!

1033
01:19:50,251 --> 01:19:52,501
Sorry, Geeta has gone out.

1034
01:19:56,542 --> 01:19:59,792
For years I have been losing
to both of you intentionally.

1035
01:20:01,542 --> 01:20:03,001
It is the truth!

1036
01:20:04,834 --> 01:20:07,167
That's it!
You see?

1037
01:20:07,709 --> 01:20:10,584
Wrestlers shine only when
the technique is right.

1038
01:20:11,292 --> 01:20:12,917
Win the Nationals soon.

1039
01:20:13,167 --> 01:20:14,417
You too will be sorted.

1040
01:20:14,792 --> 01:20:17,001
Yes... when are you coming home?

1041
01:20:17,084 --> 01:20:18,792
I'm coming next week.

1042
01:20:19,126 --> 01:20:20,001
Need something?

1043
01:20:20,084 --> 01:20:21,542
Nothing. You get here.

1044
01:20:22,042 --> 01:20:23,001
Okay.

1045
01:20:30,959 --> 01:20:32,167
Did you like it?

1046
01:20:32,417 --> 01:20:33,251
Really?

1047
01:20:33,334 --> 01:20:34,751
You grew out your hair.

1048
01:20:35,001 --> 01:20:36,542
It's looking good.

1049
01:20:37,751 --> 01:20:39,709
Your papa won't like it.

1050
01:20:42,751 --> 01:20:45,251
Now everything can't work
the way papa wants.

1051
01:20:45,542 --> 01:20:46,876
Coach-sir didn't say anything.

1052
01:20:47,126 --> 01:20:48,792
And he is such an accomplished coach.

1053
01:20:50,501 --> 01:20:52,751
You do as you please over there.

1054
01:20:53,417 --> 01:20:54,709
Just be a little careful here.

1055
01:20:54,792 --> 01:20:55,501
Mummy,

1056
01:20:55,667 --> 01:20:57,834
real training happens
with a lot of freedom.

1057
01:20:57,959 --> 01:20:59,376
Not with so many restrictions.

1058
01:20:59,584 --> 01:21:02,709
We watch movies,
television, eat out, too.

1059
01:21:02,876 --> 01:21:05,209
My performance hasn't suffered.

1060
01:21:05,376 --> 01:21:07,292
I am the topmost wrestler
at the NSA.

1061
01:21:08,459 --> 01:21:10,292
You home, wrestler?

1062
01:21:18,709 --> 01:21:20,584
- How are you?
- I am fine, papa.

1063
01:21:22,167 --> 01:21:23,542
How's your training going?

1064
01:21:23,626 --> 01:21:25,876
She's going to Sydney for a fight.

1065
01:21:28,084 --> 01:21:29,542
How's your training going?

1066
01:21:29,626 --> 01:21:31,292
It’s going very well, papa-

1067
01:21:31,376 --> 01:21:32,751
You've seen...

1068
01:21:32,834 --> 01:21:34,834
I'm learning a lot of new things.

1069
01:21:34,917 --> 01:21:37,251
New strategy, moves,
technique...

1070
01:21:37,334 --> 01:21:38,334
very good.

1071
01:21:38,542 --> 01:21:41,667
I have thought that
I will teach her some things, too.

1072
01:21:42,626 --> 01:21:44,751
After all, she too has to
win the Nationals.

1073
01:21:47,209 --> 01:21:48,792
You've grown your hair.

1074
01:21:51,626 --> 01:21:52,959
- Papa...
- No.

1075
01:21:54,834 --> 01:21:55,792
It's good.

1076
01:22:01,792 --> 01:22:04,501
Don't just attack,
you've to defend, too.

1077
01:22:04,584 --> 01:22:05,709
Hold me.

1078
01:22:06,001 --> 01:22:07,667
Now, how will you free yourself?

1079
01:22:07,876 --> 01:22:10,709
Hold this way, break and attack.

1080
01:22:10,959 --> 01:22:11,542
Got that?

1081
01:22:11,626 --> 01:22:13,709
That's an old technique.

1082
01:22:14,626 --> 01:22:15,417
Let me...

1083
01:22:17,292 --> 01:22:18,459
Hold me.

1084
01:22:19,501 --> 01:22:20,751
Tight.

1085
01:22:21,709 --> 01:22:24,126
Push your thumbs in this way,

1086
01:22:24,292 --> 01:22:25,251
and move it to the side.

1087
01:22:25,709 --> 01:22:28,084
Not in the front... but to the side.
Break and attack.

1088
01:22:28,167 --> 01:22:30,209
What's wrong with my technique?

1089
01:22:31,209 --> 01:22:32,209
What's wrong?

1090
01:22:32,292 --> 01:22:33,959
No, papa. It's not wrong.

1091
01:22:34,167 --> 01:22:37,167
This is more correct.
Coach-sir has taught it.

1092
01:22:37,334 --> 01:22:39,126
So now you are an expert?

1093
01:22:39,376 --> 01:22:40,959
International?

1094
01:22:41,751 --> 01:22:43,126
Papa, I was...

1095
01:22:43,334 --> 01:22:46,959
I'd like to know, what is it that
your coach-sir has taught you,

1096
01:22:47,292 --> 01:22:48,792
that your father couldn't.

1097
01:22:52,126 --> 01:22:54,209
Not her, show me.

1098
01:22:55,376 --> 01:22:56,501
Come on.

1099
01:22:59,376 --> 01:23:01,167
Push your thumbs in this way...

1100
01:23:06,001 --> 01:23:08,209
So, this is what your coach-sir
has taught you!

1101
01:23:08,542 --> 01:23:11,084
Is this how you'll win
an international medal?

1102
01:23:18,876 --> 01:23:19,917
I wasn't ready, papa.

1103
01:23:20,959 --> 01:23:22,209
So, get ready.

1104
01:26:03,667 --> 01:26:05,792
This is what I was saying, papa.

1105
01:26:08,542 --> 01:26:10,042
Isn't there a difference?

1106
01:26:55,751 --> 01:26:57,626
What happened today
wasn't right.

1107
01:26:58,334 --> 01:27:00,001
What wasn't right?

1108
01:27:00,792 --> 01:27:02,376
This was bound to happen.

1109
01:27:02,459 --> 01:27:05,292
Someone had to tell papa
that his techniques are weak.

1110
01:27:05,376 --> 01:27:07,751
His techniques aren't weak.

1111
01:27:07,834 --> 01:27:09,834
He's become a little weak.

1112
01:27:10,001 --> 01:27:11,584
And don't forget that
you've won the Nationals,

1113
01:27:11,667 --> 01:27:13,751
based on his "weak" techniques.

1114
01:27:13,959 --> 01:27:17,709
You can win the Nationals
with these techniques, Babita,

1115
01:27:18,334 --> 01:27:19,709
not international matches.

1116
01:27:19,792 --> 01:27:23,126
And the sooner
you realize this, the better.

1117
01:27:28,209 --> 01:27:29,542
Alright.

1118
01:27:30,042 --> 01:27:32,417
You keep faith in your techniques.

1119
01:27:32,834 --> 01:27:35,251
I still put my faith in papa.

1120
01:27:36,084 --> 01:27:40,667
I pray to God that you fight
well at the Nationals.

1121
01:27:42,084 --> 01:27:45,709
And I pray that you do well
in your international tournament.

01:31:33,501 --> 01:31:34,792
Throw her.

1162
01:31:52,292 --> 01:31:54,042
What are you doing, Geeta?

1163
01:32:02,834 --> 01:32:03,792
What are you doing, Geeta?

1164
01:32:03,876 --> 01:32:05,084
Defend!

1165
01:32:07,709 --> 01:32:09,084
Attack!

1166
01:32:11,501 --> 01:32:12,459
Good one!

1167
01:32:17,292 --> 01:32:18,334
Is this how you defend?

1168
01:32:18,626 --> 01:32:21,251
The next round, too,
play attacking.

1169
01:33:06,334 --> 01:33:08,292
You don't look happy. Papa-

1170
01:33:10,251 --> 01:33:11,542
Didn't I fight properly?

1171
01:33:13,167 --> 01:33:14,501
No, my dear.

1172
01:33:14,792 --> 01:33:17,042
You fought exactly as I expected.

1173
01:33:20,501 --> 01:33:25,417
But, I never imagined Geeta
would fight like this.

1174
01:33:30,001 --> 01:33:32,417
And now, you too,
have won the Nationals.

1175
01:33:32,751 --> 01:33:34,209
You too, will go to NSA.

1176
01:33:34,959 --> 01:33:36,626
You'll have a new coach.

1177
01:33:38,167 --> 01:33:41,626
And your papa once again
will become old.

1178
01:33:45,626 --> 01:33:46,501
No, papa.

1179
01:33:53,334 --> 01:33:55,626
Never forget,

1180
01:33:58,001 --> 01:34:00,542
how you got till here.

1181
01:34:17,667 --> 01:34:19,167
Hey, champion.

1182
01:34:20,709 --> 01:34:21,626
Hello, sis.

1183
01:34:25,251 --> 01:34:26,751
Still upset?

1184
01:34:29,917 --> 01:34:30,626
Come.

1185
01:34:31,251 --> 01:34:33,459
- What did you fill in the bag?
- Let me get it.

1186
01:34:33,542 --> 01:34:34,584
It's so heavy.

1187
01:34:35,459 --> 01:34:36,667
Hi, Jasmeet!

1188
01:34:37,876 --> 01:34:40,542
This is my younger sister, Babita.

1189
01:34:40,626 --> 01:34:43,501
Whoa! A family of wrestlers!

1190
01:34:44,959 --> 01:34:46,209
Here is the mess.

1191
01:34:46,417 --> 01:34:48,042
This is where we hog.

1192
01:34:52,626 --> 01:34:54,167
This is the lounge.

1193
01:34:54,417 --> 01:34:57,042
Here we chill and watch TV.

1194
01:34:57,959 --> 01:34:59,917
Where is the training center?

1195
01:35:02,376 --> 01:35:04,376
My, aren't you eager!

1196
01:35:05,001 --> 01:35:07,501
See it tomorrow.
Rest today.

1197
01:35:12,251 --> 01:35:13,876
Can I say something?

1198
01:35:14,001 --> 01:35:15,251
Don't feel offended.

1199
01:35:16,542 --> 01:35:17,709
Tell me.

1200
01:35:18,251 --> 01:35:20,334
You've changed a lot.

1201
01:35:22,834 --> 01:35:27,084
I remember the first time
you lost a match.

1202
01:35:27,917 --> 01:35:29,876
You couldn't sleep all night.

1203
01:35:30,334 --> 01:35:34,334
And now, in spite of losing an
international fight you are...

1204
01:35:34,792 --> 01:35:39,126
I mean, it doesn't show
at all on your face.

1205
01:35:41,209 --> 01:35:43,459
Has papa trained you
to say this?

1206
01:35:44,459 --> 01:35:47,292
I remember papa's training
very well.

1207
01:35:48,167 --> 01:35:49,667
It seems you've forgotten.

1208
01:35:49,959 --> 01:35:52,667
You focus on your training.

1209
01:35:52,959 --> 01:35:54,542
I will manage mine.

1210
01:35:55,459 --> 01:35:57,084
And why are you lecturing me?

1211
01:35:57,292 --> 01:35:59,042
I've only lost one match.

1212
01:36:03,959 --> 01:36:05,001
"Moscow."

1213
01:36:05,084 --> 01:36:07,501
<i>Geeta Kumari is trailing
in the second round as well.</i>

1214
01:36:07,584 --> 01:36:10,626
<i>She's fought well,
but hasn't managed much.</i>

1215
01:36:10,709 --> 01:36:12,167
<i>Geeta tries,</i>

1216
01:36:13,001 --> 01:36:14,917
<i>but Kasha scores one point.</i>

1217
01:36:15,584 --> 01:36:17,292
<i>And that's it!</i>

1218
01:36:17,792 --> 01:36:21,334
<i>Geeta Kumari makes an early exit
from the world championship.</i>

1219
01:36:22,167 --> 01:36:24,667
<i>What a disappointment!</i>

1220
01:36:25,292 --> 01:36:29,376
<i>Yet another defeat for
India's Geeta Kumari Phogat.</i>

1221
01:36:32,251 --> 01:36:35,751
<i>In Jakarta too, Geeta exits
in the first round.</i>

1222
01:36:37,084 --> 01:36:44,001
<i>A humiliating defeat for Geeta
in the Istanbul World Championship!</i>

1223
01:36:54,792 --> 01:36:56,334
Geeta, don't lose hope.

1224
01:36:56,459 --> 01:36:58,334
We've worked very hard.
And you played well.

1225
01:36:58,501 --> 01:36:59,709
You just couldn't win.

1226
01:37:00,167 --> 01:37:02,292
It doesn't mean you are
a bad wrestler.

1227
01:37:03,209 --> 01:37:04,084
It happens.

1228
01:37:04,251 --> 01:37:06,126
Some people are not made
for international victory.

1229
01:37:33,042 --> 01:37:34,834
Do you feel too,

1230
01:37:36,792 --> 01:37:38,959
that I'm not cut out
for an international medal?

1231
01:37:43,042 --> 01:37:45,292
I don't know about that.

1232
01:37:46,376 --> 01:37:48,334
All I know,

1233
01:37:49,126 --> 01:37:50,792
is that you are the girl,

1234
01:37:51,042 --> 01:37:53,292
who thrashed boys
in mud-wrestling.

1235
01:37:55,126 --> 01:37:56,501
You are the girl,

1236
01:37:56,709 --> 01:37:59,667
who in spite of being
underweight, won sub-juniors.

1237
01:38:01,751 --> 01:38:04,959
You beat everyone at the Nationals
for three straight years.

1238
01:38:07,959 --> 01:38:10,584
If you are not cut out
for international victory,

1239
01:38:10,834 --> 01:38:14,792
then I don't know
which girl in India is.

1240
01:38:21,667 --> 01:38:24,459
I have a lot of faith in you,

1241
01:38:25,667 --> 01:38:29,834
but it's nothing compared to
the faith that papa has in you.

1242
01:38:31,834 --> 01:38:33,751
Talk to him once.

1243
01:38:36,751 --> 01:38:38,709
How do I face him?

1244
01:38:38,959 --> 01:38:40,959
He's our papa.

1245
01:38:42,626 --> 01:38:44,417
At worst, what will happen?

1246
01:38:44,834 --> 01:38:46,251
He will give you an earful.

1247
01:38:46,542 --> 01:38:47,834
Take it.

1248
01:38:48,751 --> 01:38:51,459
His reprimands have
always helped us, haven't they?

1249
01:38:59,584 --> 01:39:00,959
Your medicine.

1250
01:39:05,959 --> 01:39:07,626
I spoke to Babita.

1251
01:39:07,834 --> 01:39:10,417
She said the training
was going well.

1252
01:39:15,001 --> 01:39:16,042
And?

1253
01:39:18,876 --> 01:39:20,584
Geeta is not okay.

1254
01:39:22,167 --> 01:39:23,917
Please talk to her once.

1255
01:39:40,834 --> 01:39:41,917
Hello.

1256
01:39:43,501 --> 01:39:44,417
Geeta?

1257
01:39:46,167 --> 01:39:48,084
Okay, wait.

1258
01:39:49,917 --> 01:39:50,876
Geeta...

1259
01:40:38,209 --> 01:40:39,834
Sorry, Papa-

1260
01:41:06,376 --> 01:41:10,542
Only six months remain for
the 19th Commonwealth Games,

1261
01:41:10,626 --> 01:41:13,209
the biggest sporting event in India.

1262
01:41:13,667 --> 01:41:19,126
What remains to be seen is how
the Indian players hold up,

1263
01:41:19,376 --> 01:41:22,459
against the world's best.

1264
01:41:41,542 --> 01:41:45,292
This time in the Commonwealth games,
I want three medals.

1265
01:41:45,584 --> 01:41:46,959
Now, whether they come
from you three,

1266
01:41:47,042 --> 01:41:48,334
you three or you three!

1267
01:41:48,542 --> 01:41:49,501
I don't care.

1268
01:41:49,584 --> 01:41:50,792
There are six months left.

1269
01:41:50,959 --> 01:41:52,376
Give your best.

1270
01:41:52,751 --> 01:41:53,709
Got that?

1271
01:41:54,084 --> 01:41:54,917
Get cracking!

1272
01:41:55,334 --> 01:41:56,209
Geeta.

1273
01:41:56,334 --> 01:41:57,167
Come here.

1274
01:42:00,667 --> 01:42:02,167
You will get one medal.

1275
01:42:02,251 --> 01:42:02,834
Yes, sir.

1276
01:42:02,917 --> 01:42:05,209
Not in the category
that you are losing in,

1277
01:42:05,292 --> 01:42:07,917
but in the category
in which you can win.

1278
01:42:08,167 --> 01:42:08,959
Got me?

1279
01:42:10,334 --> 01:42:13,542
It's difficult for you to survive
in the 55-kilo category.

1280
01:42:13,792 --> 01:42:16,292
You too must have
realised that by now.

1281
01:42:16,542 --> 01:42:17,876
In the 51-kilo category,

1282
01:42:17,959 --> 01:42:20,876
you can hold your own,
and maybe win.

1283
01:42:22,126 --> 01:42:24,251
Monitor everyone's diet strictly.

1284
01:42:24,459 --> 01:42:25,792
- No mess ups.
- Sir!

1285
01:42:27,959 --> 01:42:30,042
Sir, I want to fight in the
55-kilo category!

1286
01:42:31,959 --> 01:42:34,792
If you fight in the 55-kilo category
you'll get nowhere!

1287
01:42:38,501 --> 01:42:40,209
She has to lose four kilos.

1288
01:42:40,292 --> 01:42:41,751
Change her diet.

1289
01:42:41,959 --> 01:42:44,042
From tomorrow we'll start your
training for the 51-kilo category.

1290
01:42:45,417 --> 01:42:46,709
Come on, girls.

1291
01:42:50,459 --> 01:42:52,584
Why won't you win
in the 55-kilo category?

1292
01:42:52,876 --> 01:42:54,876
No need for you to lose weight!

1293
01:42:55,126 --> 01:42:57,751
You will fight in the
55-kilo category, and win!

1294
01:42:58,126 --> 01:43:00,001
I'm coming to Patiala.

1295
01:43:07,334 --> 01:43:09,792
We don't know anyone in Patiala.

1296
01:43:10,126 --> 01:43:12,084
How will you stay for six months?

1297
01:43:12,376 --> 01:43:13,501
On rent.

1298
01:43:13,667 --> 01:43:14,792
And food?

1299
01:43:15,042 --> 01:43:16,042
I'll cook.

1300
01:43:16,126 --> 01:43:17,751
I'll cook, uncle!

1301
01:43:19,042 --> 01:43:21,042
I was thinking that
I too could come along.

1302
01:43:22,042 --> 01:43:23,167
What will you do there?

1303
01:43:23,584 --> 01:43:26,917
Well, in the past they did well
when they trained with me.

1304
01:43:27,084 --> 01:43:29,209
So, if they train with me
in the future too...

1305
01:43:29,459 --> 01:43:31,501
Honestly, I think I am
their good luck charm.

1306
01:43:32,709 --> 01:43:34,209
I mean... that's what I think.

1307
01:43:35,834 --> 01:43:39,417
And, I will buy vegetables for you,
chop them for you,

1308
01:43:39,626 --> 01:43:42,042
run errands for you,
press your feet.

1309
01:43:42,417 --> 01:43:43,876
I'll make sure you are stress-free.

1310
01:43:44,042 --> 01:43:45,917
You see...
it's the Commonwealth Games.

1311
01:43:46,167 --> 01:43:47,626
We can't take any chances.

1312
01:43:52,792 --> 01:43:54,667
Start preparing for gold!

1313
01:43:54,876 --> 01:43:57,584
"Patiala."

1314
01:44:00,959 --> 01:44:02,709
The room is on top.

1315
01:44:03,751 --> 01:44:04,542
Come.

1316
01:44:07,917 --> 01:44:09,959
Is there no other room,
in the same budget?

1317
01:44:10,251 --> 01:44:11,292
It's nice.

1318
01:44:11,376 --> 01:44:12,542
Yes!

1319
01:44:12,626 --> 01:44:13,834
It's nice, indeed.

1320
01:44:14,209 --> 01:44:15,167
I have to admit!

1321
01:44:20,334 --> 01:44:21,292
Yes?

1322
01:44:21,376 --> 01:44:25,584
Geeta and Babita Kumari's
father and close cousin.

1323
01:44:30,376 --> 01:44:32,501
Holy cow!

1324
01:44:40,501 --> 01:44:42,834
Uncle, doesn't this place
seem lovely?

1325
01:45:00,876 --> 01:45:02,084
How are you, champ?

1326
01:45:06,667 --> 01:45:07,376
And you?

1327
01:45:07,584 --> 01:45:08,751
I’m good, papa.

1328
01:45:10,334 --> 01:45:11,209
Why are you here?

1329
01:45:11,417 --> 01:45:12,959
Uncle insisted that I come.

1330
01:45:13,084 --> 01:45:15,417
He said it's the Commonwealth Games.
We can't take a chance.

1331
01:45:15,501 --> 01:45:16,709
Shut up, 'TTSS'!

1332
01:45:19,167 --> 01:45:21,542
Geeta's 51-kilo category
training has started,

1333
01:45:21,667 --> 01:45:22,959
and the diet too.

1334
01:45:24,959 --> 01:45:27,084
You continue their diet and training,

1335
01:45:27,542 --> 01:45:29,959
I'll supplement the rest.

1336
01:45:32,417 --> 01:45:34,334
What time does
your training start?

1337
01:45:34,709 --> 01:45:35,584
7 a.m.

1338
01:45:36,542 --> 01:45:37,584
Okay.

1339
01:45:37,792 --> 01:45:39,292
Be ready at 5 a.m. tomorrow.

1355
01:47:08,209 --> 01:47:09,459
Stop... stop.

1356
01:47:10,209 --> 01:47:11,709
Straight attacks won't do.

1357
01:47:12,084 --> 01:47:14,126
You have to play with
the opponent's mind.

1358
01:47:15,251 --> 01:47:19,417
Fake a move...
but make another.

1359
01:47:35,126 --> 01:47:36,667
Sir, I had put her on a diet,

1360
01:47:36,751 --> 01:47:38,876
but, I don't know why
it hasn't reduced.

1361
01:47:40,959 --> 01:47:42,626
What have you been up to, Geeta?

1362
01:47:44,959 --> 01:47:47,792
Will you say something
or just keep crying?

1363
01:47:57,334 --> 01:48:01,501
Sir, judging by their actions
I feel they don't need NSA.

1364
01:48:02,709 --> 01:48:04,667
The rest is up to you.

1365
01:48:08,459 --> 01:48:10,251
Do you all have anything to say?

1366
01:48:13,959 --> 01:48:16,292
So you admit you are at fault.

1367
01:48:16,834 --> 01:48:19,042
Sir, they have just one fault.

1368
01:48:19,459 --> 01:48:21,001
That their father is crazy.

1369
01:48:23,417 --> 01:48:26,959
He is so crazy about getting
a gold for the country,

1370
01:48:27,959 --> 01:48:30,584
that in their childhood itself
he snatched away their toys,

1371
01:48:30,917 --> 01:48:32,542
and made them wrestle.

1372
01:48:33,876 --> 01:48:36,167
When they resisted,
he cut their hair off.

1373
01:48:36,667 --> 01:48:39,709
In order to prepare them,
he made them wrestle boys.

1374
01:48:40,084 --> 01:48:42,542
Took the taunts and abuses
of the entire village,

1375
01:48:43,584 --> 01:48:45,876
just so that one day they would
make the country proud.

1376
01:48:55,417 --> 01:48:56,584
Look, sir.

1377
01:48:56,917 --> 01:48:57,584
Look.

1378
01:48:57,917 --> 01:48:59,792
These 50 rupees
she won at Rohtak.

1379
01:49:00,084 --> 01:49:01,459
This in Hisar.

1380
01:49:02,876 --> 01:49:04,084
This in Chandigarh.

1381
01:49:04,751 --> 01:49:08,667
This... this, all this... sir.

1382
01:49:09,417 --> 01:49:12,834
These girls have traveled
a long way to reach here, sir.

1383
01:49:13,292 --> 01:49:15,959
Now don't tell them to turn back.

1384
01:49:16,542 --> 01:49:17,876
It's all my fault.

1385
01:49:18,167 --> 01:49:19,792
I humbly apologise.

1386
01:49:28,167 --> 01:49:30,542
Coach-sir is just concerned
with getting three medals.

1387
01:49:30,751 --> 01:49:32,584
No matter if they are bronze.

1388
01:49:33,251 --> 01:49:35,917
But I want our country
to win gold.

1389
01:49:36,709 --> 01:49:38,834
And this girl can do it, sir.

1390
01:49:50,709 --> 01:49:52,376
All of you, please wait outside.

1391
01:50:02,084 --> 01:50:04,501
You've made a mistake
by wasting time.

1392
01:50:05,917 --> 01:50:08,876
In 55-kilos, Geeta won't even
get selected for India.

1393
01:50:10,042 --> 01:50:12,584
If she had fought in the 51-kilos
she could've won a medal.

1394
01:50:13,376 --> 01:50:17,959
She should've won a medal
much earlier, in 55-kilos itself.

1395
01:50:18,459 --> 01:50:20,042
You are responsible for that!

1396
01:50:20,334 --> 01:50:21,292
What did I do wrong?

1397
01:50:21,501 --> 01:50:23,876
Geeta's natural game is attacking.

1398
01:50:24,667 --> 01:50:28,751
By putting technique above instinct,
you've changed her game.

1399
01:50:29,292 --> 01:50:32,376
It's like telling a tiger
to fight like an elephant.

1400
01:50:33,876 --> 01:50:36,792
You'll be left with neither
a tiger nor an elephant.

1401
01:50:36,959 --> 01:50:38,209
So, why don't you tell me,

1402
01:50:38,501 --> 01:50:40,792
how to fight to win a medal!

1403
01:50:41,042 --> 01:50:45,209
With your permission, I would like to
demonstrate it here and now.

1404
01:50:45,584 --> 01:50:46,917
They're calling you inside.

1405
01:50:51,334 --> 01:50:52,709
What happened was wrong.

1406
01:50:52,959 --> 01:50:55,542
But the committee has decided
to give them another chance.

1407
01:50:55,709 --> 01:50:56,542
Thank you, sir.

1408
01:50:56,667 --> 01:50:58,959
But, from today,

1409
01:50:59,626 --> 01:51:01,917
neither are you allowed
to enter the NSA premises,

1410
01:51:02,334 --> 01:51:05,334
nor are they allowed
to step out.

1411
01:51:09,251 --> 01:51:10,167
Okay, sir.

1412
01:51:16,584 --> 01:51:19,126
Today, make one for me too, uncle.

1413
01:51:22,126 --> 01:51:23,167
Sorry.

1414
01:51:29,584 --> 01:51:30,626
Thank you.

1415
01:51:35,792 --> 01:51:37,501
We had come to play the lead role,

1416
01:51:37,584 --> 01:51:40,251
NSA made ours
a guest appearance.

1417
01:51:40,792 --> 01:51:42,584
Let's head back now.

1418
01:51:43,251 --> 01:51:44,626
No, Omkar.

1419
01:51:45,209 --> 01:51:47,959
They can stop me
from going inside,

1420
01:51:49,209 --> 01:51:52,542
but no one can stop me
from coaching Geeta.

1421
01:51:54,001 --> 01:51:54,959
Cheers, uncle.

1422
01:51:57,334 --> 01:51:59,251
Against three of them
I held my own.

1423
01:51:59,417 --> 01:52:01,834
But the one who
took me to the cleaners...

1424
01:52:01,917 --> 01:52:05,417
she was smaller than me
and not that strong either.

1425
01:52:05,584 --> 01:52:07,251
Do you have a recording
of this match?

1426
01:52:07,417 --> 01:52:09,542
Yes papa, in the library.

1427
01:52:09,626 --> 01:52:11,709
Courier me a copy of all.

1428
01:52:18,334 --> 01:52:21,501
Only three months remain
for the Delhi Commonwealth Games.

1429
01:52:21,584 --> 01:52:25,792
And the fervor can be sensed at the
National Sports Academy in Patiala.

1430
01:52:28,376 --> 01:52:30,376
Where are we going, uncle?

1431
01:52:31,917 --> 01:52:34,751
<i>The one thing
I disliked about uncle,</i>

1432
01:52:35,126 --> 01:52:37,459
<i>was his constant
air of suspense.</i>

1433
01:52:37,584 --> 01:52:39,876
<i>It could kill you!</i>

1434
01:52:43,376 --> 01:52:45,542
"CrazyCougar.com."

1435
01:52:45,792 --> 01:52:47,667
"The Lustful Aunt."

1436
01:52:49,542 --> 01:52:52,376
If you want to watch a movie,
let's go to Amar Mahal.

1437
01:52:52,501 --> 01:52:54,167
They don't show decent films here.

1438
01:52:54,584 --> 01:52:55,667
Get off.

1439
01:52:58,334 --> 01:52:59,667
"Wild Daughter."

1440
01:53:00,751 --> 01:53:01,209
Yes?

1441
01:53:01,292 --> 01:53:03,917
How much for all the tickets
of the next show?

1442
01:53:04,751 --> 01:53:07,042
Which film do you want to watch?

1443
01:53:07,459 --> 01:53:08,709
We've brought it with us.

1444
01:53:12,667 --> 01:53:13,917
Pause.

1445
01:53:18,209 --> 01:53:19,459
Play.

1446
01:53:32,792 --> 01:53:33,667
Are you done?

1447
01:53:33,751 --> 01:53:34,876
Be happy-

1448
01:53:34,959 --> 01:53:36,667
Your next show is sold-out too.

1449
01:53:36,876 --> 01:53:39,917
What are you guys up to?

1450
01:53:40,126 --> 01:53:42,209
I mean, where is the movie from?

1451
01:53:42,376 --> 01:53:45,417
Atlanta... Indonesia.

1452
01:53:45,501 --> 01:53:46,751
- Imported?
- Yes.

1453
01:53:46,834 --> 01:53:48,959
Listen, can I make a copy?

1454
01:53:49,042 --> 01:53:50,959
Give me 50 rupees less.

1455
01:53:55,626 --> 01:53:58,501
How will she win
if she fights like this?

1456
01:53:59,167 --> 01:54:00,459
Uncle!

1457
01:54:01,542 --> 01:54:05,542
Uncle, you've gathered
the knowledge,

1458
01:54:05,834 --> 01:54:07,459
but how will you pass it on?

1459
01:54:07,542 --> 01:54:10,376
NSA has issued a 'shoot-at-sight'
order against you.

1460
01:54:13,084 --> 01:54:14,042
Sit.

1461
01:54:15,084 --> 01:54:16,542
<i>Again... suspense!</i>

1462
01:54:17,292 --> 01:54:18,876
Is this how you fight?

1463
01:54:18,959 --> 01:54:20,751
Like a quivering kitten?

1464
01:54:21,417 --> 01:54:23,626
If this is how you want to fight,
then don't.

1465
01:54:23,709 --> 01:54:24,792
What happened, papa?

1466
01:54:24,876 --> 01:54:27,167
I saw all your matches.

1467
01:54:27,792 --> 01:54:30,084
You weren't wrestling,
that's for sure!

1468
01:54:31,167 --> 01:54:34,126
Do you have copies of
the DVDs that you gave me?

1469
01:54:34,501 --> 01:54:35,459
Yes, papa.

1470
01:54:35,626 --> 01:54:38,042
Can you arrange to watch
them alone?

1471
01:54:38,334 --> 01:54:39,792
I'll borrow a laptop.

1472
01:54:40,501 --> 01:54:41,334
Alright.

1473
01:54:41,542 --> 01:54:43,209
Be ready at 5 a.m. tomorrow.

1474
01:54:48,751 --> 01:54:50,667
It's been a while since
papa gave me an earful.

1475
01:54:52,459 --> 01:54:53,334
Felt good.

1476
01:54:55,459 --> 01:54:57,792
Play the Jakarta fight, round one.

1477
01:54:58,209 --> 01:54:59,209
I have, papa.

1478
01:54:59,376 --> 01:55:01,376
Go to three minutes 58 seconds.

1479
01:55:02,959 --> 01:55:04,876
You have a lead of two points,

1480
01:55:04,959 --> 01:55:06,709
and you started
playing defensive.

1481
01:55:08,376 --> 01:55:09,834
Play. Look.

1482
01:55:12,459 --> 01:55:14,001
Threw away the lead, didn't you?

1483
01:55:15,917 --> 01:55:18,876
When the opponent is trailing,
go for the jugular!

1484
01:55:26,292 --> 01:55:27,459
How did you do that?

1485
01:55:28,917 --> 01:55:32,501
Alternately, when you should be defending,
you are attacking and giving away points.

1486
01:55:32,876 --> 01:55:35,501
You will gain nothing by
desperately chasing after points.

1487
01:55:35,834 --> 01:55:37,959
You'll have to apply your mind.

1488
01:55:38,209 --> 01:55:40,626
You've lost matches
that were yours to win!

1489
01:55:48,709 --> 01:55:49,751
Go... Geeta!

1490
01:55:49,959 --> 01:55:52,667
"National Trials, Patiala."

1491
01:56:07,001 --> 01:56:09,834
Each round consists of two minutes.

1492
01:56:10,542 --> 01:56:15,376
However, there are 120 seconds
in those two minutes.

1493
01:56:15,751 --> 01:56:20,334
Wait for that one second
when the opponent makes a mistake.

1494
01:56:24,751 --> 01:56:26,792
She's good. Isn't she?

1495
01:56:27,751 --> 01:56:28,792
Yes, sir.

1496
01:56:30,376 --> 01:56:31,459
Very good!

1497
01:56:35,834 --> 01:56:38,167
Now you look ready, sis.

1498
01:56:39,209 --> 01:56:40,584
Did you tell papa?

1499
01:56:41,376 --> 01:56:42,334
What did he say?

1500
01:56:43,376 --> 01:56:45,542
"There's no need to get too happy!"

1501
01:56:51,959 --> 01:56:55,792
<i>A grand opening ceremony
to the 2010 Commonwealth Games!</i>

1502
01:56:58,084 --> 01:57:01,959
<i>Host nation, India, displaying
her ancient culture.</i>

1503
01:57:02,251 --> 01:57:04,834
<i>A proud moment indeed!</i>

1504
01:57:09,292 --> 01:57:12,334
<i>And here comes
the Indian contingent!</i>

1505
01:57:17,626 --> 01:57:20,959
<i>A huge welcome for them.</i>

1506
01:57:24,084 --> 01:57:27,459
<i>Let us remind you that
the finest athletes,</i>

1507
01:57:27,542 --> 01:57:30,251
<i>from 72 countries are participating.</i>

1508
01:57:30,834 --> 01:57:34,417
<i>We'll be back tomorrow
to start off the events.</i>

1509
01:57:34,792 --> 01:57:36,876
<i>Until then... goodnight!</i>

1510
01:57:42,667 --> 01:57:46,292
<i>Geeta was quite nervous
before her first bout.</i>

1511
01:57:46,751 --> 01:57:48,376
<i>And that was expected.</i>

1512
01:57:48,584 --> 01:57:52,876
<i>So far her performance
in international events had been poor.</i>

1513
01:57:53,709 --> 01:57:58,001
<i>However little... the nation
still had hope on her.</i>

1514
01:57:59,084 --> 01:58:01,876
<i>And this was probably
Geeta's last opportunity,</i>

1515
01:58:01,959 --> 01:58:03,417
<i>to prove herself.</i>

1516
01:58:09,209 --> 01:58:12,417
<i>The first match in women's wrestling,
55-kilo category, is between,</i>

1517
01:58:12,584 --> 01:58:16,292
<i>India's Geeta Kumari and
Melissa Anderson from Wales.</i>

1518
01:58:16,709 --> 01:58:17,917
Go, Geeta!

1519
01:58:18,334 --> 01:58:20,167
<i>Geeta seems quite nervous.</i>

1520
01:58:20,334 --> 01:58:22,792
<i>Now, let's see if she can
break her jinx,</i>

1521
01:58:22,876 --> 01:58:26,792
<i>of losing in the first
couple of rounds.</i>

1522
01:58:27,459 --> 01:58:29,084
<i>We would like to remind
our spectators,</i>

1523
01:58:29,167 --> 01:58:31,542
<i>that there will be three rounds
of two minutes each.</i>

1524
01:58:32,292 --> 01:58:35,417
<i>Whoever wins two rounds,
wins the match.</i>

1525
01:58:38,459 --> 01:58:40,542
<i>With that the match begins.</i>

1526
01:58:42,709 --> 01:58:44,584
<i>Both the wrestlers are quite alert.</i>

1527
01:58:52,792 --> 01:58:54,334
<i>1 point to Melissa.</i>

1528
01:58:54,417 --> 01:58:56,876
<i>Melissa - 1; Geeta - 0.</i>

1529
01:59:02,251 --> 01:59:04,959
<i>Melissa seems stronger.</i>

1530
01:59:06,709 --> 01:59:08,251
<i>3 more points to Melissa!</i>

1531
01:59:08,334 --> 01:59:09,501
What are you doing, Geeta?

1532
01:59:10,834 --> 01:59:12,626
<i>Melissa - 4; Geeta - 0.</i>

1533
01:59:12,709 --> 01:59:14,959
<i>If Geeta gives away
2 more points,</i>

1534
01:59:15,042 --> 01:59:18,334
<i>Melissa will win this round
on technical superiority.</i>

1535
01:59:24,542 --> 01:59:26,667
<i>And Melissa gets 2 points!</i>

1536
01:59:28,876 --> 01:59:30,959
<i>Exactly as we feared.</i>

1537
01:59:31,501 --> 01:59:36,376
<i>Melissa has won the first round
on technical superiority; 6-0.</i>

1538
01:59:37,334 --> 01:59:38,376
What are you doing, Geeta?

1539
01:59:38,959 --> 01:59:40,792
Don't lose so badly!

1540
01:59:41,501 --> 01:59:44,709
<i>We now need to see that
after losing the first round badly,</i>

1541
01:59:44,792 --> 01:59:47,626
<i>is Geeta capable of making
a comeback in round two.</i>

1542
01:59:56,167 --> 01:59:57,959
<i>2 points to Melissa.</i>

1543
01:59:59,626 --> 02:00:01,376
<i>1 more point to Melissa.</i>

1544
02:00:01,917 --> 02:00:05,542
<i>The match seems to be
slipping out of Geeta's hands.</i>

1545
02:00:07,042 --> 02:00:08,792
You are not to lose, Geeta!

1546
02:00:16,501 --> 02:00:17,876
Come on, Geeta.

1547
02:00:21,792 --> 02:00:23,501
<i>Geeta, lagging by 3 points.</i>

1548
02:00:23,876 --> 02:00:25,667
<i>She'll have to score real quick.</i>

1549
02:00:34,334 --> 02:00:36,084
<i>2 points to Geeta!</i>

1550
02:00:36,667 --> 02:00:39,251
<i>Melissa - 3; Geeta - 2.</i>

1551
02:00:39,709 --> 02:00:41,876
<i>Geeta tries to score some more,</i>

1552
02:00:42,417 --> 02:00:43,959
<i>but the referee blows the whistle.</i>

1553
02:00:44,459 --> 02:00:46,376
<i>The round is nearing completion.</i>

1554
02:00:46,459 --> 02:00:48,501
<i>Geeta is still behind by a point.</i>

1555
02:00:55,501 --> 02:00:58,251
<i>Geeta in trouble!</i>

1556
02:01:01,042 --> 02:01:02,959
<i>Geeta gets 3 points!</i>

1557
02:01:03,209 --> 02:01:05,626
<i>Geeta - 5; Melissa - 3.</i>

1558
02:01:06,626 --> 02:01:11,126
<i>Just four seconds to go.</i>

1559
02:01:12,501 --> 02:01:13,751
Yes, Geeta!

1560
02:01:16,792 --> 02:01:19,292
<i>Geeta's back in the match!</i>

1561
02:01:19,376 --> 02:01:21,501
<i>It's one round each.</i>

1562
02:01:21,709 --> 02:01:27,001
<i>Geeta has shown that she is not
going to accept defeat so easily.</i>

1563
02:01:27,542 --> 02:01:30,334
It's the last round.

1564
02:01:30,792 --> 02:01:32,584
Play defensive.

1565
02:01:34,917 --> 02:01:35,917
Got it?

1566
02:01:36,417 --> 02:01:37,834
Play attacking!

1567
02:01:46,626 --> 02:01:48,126
<i>And the last round begins.</i>

1568
02:01:49,251 --> 02:01:51,084
<i>Geeta on the attack.</i>

1569
02:01:54,626 --> 02:01:56,042
<i>1 point for Geeta.</i>

1570
02:01:56,501 --> 02:01:59,001
<i>Geeta - 1; Melissa - 0.</i>

1571
02:02:08,501 --> 02:02:10,334
<i>2 more points in Geeta's kitty.</i>

1572
02:02:10,709 --> 02:02:12,917
Geeta-<i>3; Melissa</i> - <i>0.</i>

1573
02:02:13,542 --> 02:02:16,376
<i>Will she manage to keep her lead?</i>

1574
02:02:17,834 --> 02:02:19,376
Very good. Defend now.

1575
02:02:27,917 --> 02:02:29,584
<i>3 points for Melissa!</i>

1576
02:02:29,751 --> 02:02:31,001
I told you to defend.

1577
02:02:31,209 --> 02:02:33,001
No problem.
Keep attacking!

1578
02:02:33,084 --> 02:02:35,042
<i>The score is equal at 3-3.</i>

1579
02:02:37,459 --> 02:02:39,459
Go for it, Geeta!

1580
02:02:39,959 --> 02:02:42,251
<i>This match can tilt either way.</i>

1581
02:02:42,626 --> 02:02:47,001
<i>Geeta was poised to win
but lost her lead.</i>

1582
02:02:49,876 --> 02:02:51,584
<i>Geeta's in danger.</i>

1583
02:02:52,584 --> 02:02:53,709
<i>Wow! What a move!</i>

1584
02:02:53,792 --> 02:02:55,126
<i>3 points to Geeta!</i>

1585
02:02:55,209 --> 02:02:56,834
Keep her down, Geeta.

1586
02:03:02,834 --> 02:03:06,376
<i>Geeta has won this match!</i>

1587
02:03:08,292 --> 02:03:11,376
<i>India's Geeta Kumari Phogat,</i>

1588
02:03:11,459 --> 02:03:17,251
<i>has proven her critics wrong.</i>

1589
02:03:18,917 --> 02:03:24,792
<i>A proud moment for Geeta's father,
Mahavir Singh Phogat!</i>

1590
02:03:34,126 --> 02:03:35,626
So far India has won,

1591
02:03:35,709 --> 02:03:39,001
five gold, 13 silver
and seven bronze medals.

1592
02:03:39,459 --> 02:03:41,792
In women's wrestling,
India's Geeta Kumari Phogat,

1593
02:03:41,959 --> 02:03:45,584
has entered the semi-finals
of the 55-kilo category.

1594
02:03:45,959 --> 02:03:50,292
Geeta will now face
Nigeria's Naomi Edwards,

1595
02:03:50,376 --> 02:03:52,417
two time world champion.

1596
02:03:53,042 --> 02:03:53,876
What do you think?

1597
02:03:53,959 --> 02:03:56,501
Naomi is a very strong wrestler.

1598
02:03:56,584 --> 02:03:58,959
Extremely aggressive and attacking.

1599
02:03:59,501 --> 02:04:04,251
She doesn't give any
opportunity to her opponent.

1600
02:04:08,542 --> 02:04:12,001
It's not going to be easy
for Geeta this time.

1601
02:04:17,251 --> 02:04:19,334
Today, you played as per your will.

1602
02:04:19,542 --> 02:04:21,917
Now, do as I say.

1603
02:04:22,501 --> 02:04:24,167
Or it's impossible to win.

1604
02:04:24,251 --> 02:04:26,751
It's a difficult one,

1605
02:04:27,167 --> 02:04:28,626
but not impossible.

1606
02:04:29,792 --> 02:04:32,292
You'll have to play offensive!

1607
02:04:32,417 --> 02:04:34,292
You have to play defensive.

1608
02:04:34,376 --> 02:04:35,917
Just go for the points!

1609
02:04:36,001 --> 02:04:38,376
Don't go for the points.

1610
02:04:38,459 --> 02:04:40,376
You'll get a lot of opportunities.

1611
02:04:40,459 --> 02:04:43,917
Don't give her any opportunities
because she won't give you any.

1612
02:04:44,251 --> 02:04:46,417
Force a lock-jam each time.

1613
02:04:47,209 --> 02:04:49,501
If she doesn't get to score,
she'll get frustrated,

1614
02:04:49,834 --> 02:04:51,209
and will give you an opportunity.

1615
02:04:51,376 --> 02:04:54,292
That's the moment
we should grab!

1616
02:04:55,376 --> 02:04:58,667
<i>The first semi-final match in
the 55-kilo category.</i>

1617
02:04:58,917 --> 02:05:02,917
<i>India's Geeta Kumari
versus Nigeria's Naomi Edwards.</i>

1618
02:05:06,834 --> 02:05:09,209
<i>Naomi attacking from the start.</i>

1619
02:05:10,126 --> 02:05:12,959
<i>And against her nature,
Geeta playing defensive.</i>

1620
02:05:14,626 --> 02:05:16,209
<i>Naomi attacks!</i>

1621
02:05:16,292 --> 02:05:18,251
<i>Geeta in trouble.</i>

1622
02:05:18,334 --> 02:05:21,209
<i>Geeta putting up a strong defense.</i>

1623
02:05:21,501 --> 02:05:23,501
<i>Geeta holding her back.</i>

1624
02:05:28,876 --> 02:05:30,917
<i>Naomi made a strong attempt.</i>

1625
02:05:31,167 --> 02:05:33,209
<i>But Geeta held her own.</i>

1626
02:05:33,876 --> 02:05:35,126
Go on the attack!

1627
02:05:35,876 --> 02:05:37,126
Go easy.

1628
02:05:38,667 --> 02:05:40,042
<i>Naomi gets rough.</i>

1629
02:05:40,417 --> 02:05:42,209
<i>She seems frustrated.</i>

1630
02:05:43,667 --> 02:05:46,084
<i>Naomi twisting Geeta's wrist.</i>

1631
02:05:52,084 --> 02:05:56,292
<i>Naomi is being given a warning.</i>

1632
02:05:56,376 --> 02:05:58,042
Hang in there, Geeta!

1633
02:06:10,292 --> 02:06:11,959
<i>That's 3 points for Naomi!</i>

1634
02:06:12,876 --> 02:06:15,126
<i>Geeta had been
holding her off well.</i>

1635
02:06:15,209 --> 02:06:16,334
<i>A really good effort,</i>

1636
02:06:16,417 --> 02:06:18,459
<i>but Naomi's broken
through her defense.</i>

1637
02:06:20,626 --> 02:06:23,417
<i>Geeta has to act fast.</i>

1638
02:06:29,834 --> 02:06:31,334
<i>Geeta takes Naomi down.</i>

1639
02:06:31,417 --> 02:06:32,501
<i>1 point to Geeta!</i>

1640
02:06:32,584 --> 02:06:34,084
<i>She's still trying.</i>

1641
02:06:40,167 --> 02:06:41,834
<i>And time's up!</i>

1642
02:06:42,126 --> 02:06:45,501
<i>Geeta played well,
but she's lost this first round.</i>

1643
02:06:46,251 --> 02:06:47,334
What are you doing, Geeta?

1644
02:06:47,792 --> 02:06:49,126
Why don't you attack?

1645
02:06:56,334 --> 02:06:58,667
<i>The second round begins.</i>

1646
02:07:06,417 --> 02:07:07,584
<i>Naomi attacks.</i>

1647
02:07:24,459 --> 02:07:26,334
<i>Naomi tries to flip Geeta.</i>

1648
02:07:26,417 --> 02:07:28,834
<i>But Geeta defends well.</i>

1649
02:07:32,542 --> 02:07:34,292
<i>Naomi puts all her strength,</i>

1650
02:07:34,584 --> 02:07:37,459
<i>but Geeta isn't giving her a chance.</i>

1651
02:07:38,334 --> 02:07:40,667
<i>This is an exciting match.</i>

1652
02:07:42,126 --> 02:07:44,334
<i>Naomi trying hard,</i>

1653
02:07:44,709 --> 02:07:46,959
<i>but Geeta not giving her space.</i>

1654
02:07:48,251 --> 02:07:50,667
<i>Naomi attacks again.</i>

1655
02:07:51,084 --> 02:07:52,626
<i>Geeta defends.</i>

1656
02:08:00,292 --> 02:08:02,459
<i>A nice defense by Geeta.</i>

1657
02:08:15,751 --> 02:08:17,751
<i>The referee breaks the fight.</i>

1658
02:08:17,834 --> 02:08:20,167
<i>Second round is still 0-0.</i>

1659
02:08:20,876 --> 02:08:26,542
<i>Naomi must be wondering
how to break Geeta's defense.</i>

1660
02:08:30,167 --> 02:08:33,042
<i>"If she doesn't get to score,
she'll get frustrated,</i>

1661
02:08:33,334 --> 02:08:34,209
<i>and will give you an opportunity."</i>

1662
02:08:34,459 --> 02:08:35,959
<i>Naomi attacks.</i>

1663
02:08:37,167 --> 02:08:39,209
<i>"That's the moment
we should grab!"</i>

1664
02:08:42,709 --> 02:08:44,542
<i>3 Points!</i>

1665
02:08:44,959 --> 02:08:48,709
<i>And Geeta wins this round, 3-0.</i>

1666
02:08:51,167 --> 02:08:52,417
Naomi, look at me.

1667
02:08:53,084 --> 02:08:54,084
That girl, she's smart.

1668
02:08:54,167 --> 02:08:55,209
But you are double smart.

1669
02:08:55,584 --> 02:08:56,376
Okay?

1670
02:08:56,626 --> 02:08:58,376
Don't allow her to turn you easily.

1671
02:08:58,542 --> 02:08:59,626
How are you fighting?

1672
02:08:59,917 --> 02:09:03,417
Sir, I am fighting as I have learnt.

1673
02:09:06,126 --> 02:09:08,251
<i>The third and final round has started.</i>

1674
02:09:10,376 --> 02:09:11,792
<i>It's interesting to see,</i>

1675
02:09:11,876 --> 02:09:15,167
<i>that Naomi is now
playing cautiously.</i>

1676
02:09:34,251 --> 02:09:36,126
<i>Naomi trying real hard.</i>

1677
02:09:36,334 --> 02:09:38,459
<i>But Geeta holding her back.</i>

1678
02:09:39,084 --> 02:09:40,834
<i>It's a lock position again.</i>

1679
02:09:48,167 --> 02:09:49,376
<i>Naomi attacks again.</i>

1680
02:09:49,876 --> 02:09:51,501
<i>Geeta holds her back.</i>

1681
02:09:54,167 --> 02:09:56,084
<i>Will Naomi score?</i>

1682
02:09:57,334 --> 02:09:59,376
Hold on, Geeta!

1683
02:10:05,334 --> 02:10:07,959
<i>The score stands at 0-0.</i>

1684
02:10:08,376 --> 02:10:10,084
<i>Naomi tries harder.</i>

1685
02:10:13,001 --> 02:10:15,792
<i>Geeta is exposed here
but holds her back.</i>

1686
02:10:30,751 --> 02:10:33,084
<i>Geeta hanging on
by the skin of her teeth.</i>

1687
02:10:33,209 --> 02:10:35,626
<i>Only 12 seconds left.</i>

1688
02:10:36,417 --> 02:10:38,542
<i>The score still 0-0.</i>

1689
02:10:40,251 --> 02:10:41,667
<i>Geeta attacks!</i>

1690
02:10:48,959 --> 02:10:53,042
<i>With that this round is tied at 0-0.</i>

1691
02:10:53,459 --> 02:10:55,209
She could have scored.

1692
02:10:55,709 --> 02:10:56,959
Now there'll be a toss.

1693
02:10:57,376 --> 02:10:59,542
<i>Now there will be a toss.</i>

1694
02:10:59,751 --> 02:11:02,334
<i>This is known as a 'clinch’.</i>

1695
02:11:02,751 --> 02:11:06,917
<i>The wrestler who wins the toss
gets to choose a grip,</i>

1696
02:11:07,459 --> 02:11:10,626
<i>and gets 30 seconds to score.</i>

1697
02:11:11,376 --> 02:11:14,126
<i>If the red side falls up,
Naomi gets to attack,</i>

1698
02:11:14,501 --> 02:11:17,084
<i>if it's blue, Geeta gets to attack.</i>

1699
02:11:17,459 --> 02:11:20,001
<i>In 99 percent of the cases
the one who wins the toss,</i>

1700
02:11:20,084 --> 02:11:21,542
<i>wins the match.</i>

1701
02:11:34,501 --> 02:11:35,792
<i>Oh!</i>

1702
02:11:35,876 --> 02:11:39,251
<i>Maybe even destiny
doesn't want Geeta to win.</i>

1703
02:11:40,792 --> 02:11:44,292
<i>It's next to impossible to defend
against Naomi for 30 seconds.</i>

1704
02:11:46,501 --> 02:11:48,167
<i>- Which leg do you choose?
- Right.</i>

1705
02:11:48,376 --> 02:11:51,084
<i>Naomi has chosen
Geeta's right leg.</i>

1706
02:11:51,751 --> 02:11:54,042
<i>Geeta takes a defensive position.</i>

1707
02:11:55,167 --> 02:11:57,542
<i>Naomi takes her grip of choice.</i>

1708
02:11:58,542 --> 02:12:00,084
<i>Now, Geeta has two options.</i>

1709
02:12:00,959 --> 02:12:03,042
<i>Not allow Naomi to score
for 30 seconds,</i>

1710
02:12:03,126 --> 02:12:05,459
<i>or score herself,
and win the match.</i>

1711
02:12:06,584 --> 02:12:10,959
<i>In this position against Naomi,
both are almost impossible.</i>

1712
02:12:27,126 --> 02:12:29,542
<i>She lifts Geeta!</i>

1713
02:12:33,792 --> 02:12:36,751
<i>And Geeta scores a point!</i>

1714
02:12:42,042 --> 02:12:45,542
<i>No one expected
Geeta to win this match.</i>

1715
02:12:46,376 --> 02:12:50,959
<i>She has beaten the number one
contender for gold,</i>

1716
02:12:51,042 --> 02:12:54,167
<i>in this very exciting clinch,</i>

1717
02:12:54,251 --> 02:12:57,209
<i>and entered the finals!</i>

1718
02:12:58,084 --> 02:13:01,001
<i>And let's hope that
Geeta Phogat,</i>

1719
02:13:01,292 --> 02:13:04,709
<i>maintains her wonderful form
in the finals too.</i>

1720
02:13:24,417 --> 02:13:25,917
Shall we go, uncle?

1721
02:13:26,209 --> 02:13:27,876
Let's see the next match.

1722
02:13:28,251 --> 02:13:30,876
Let's find out whether Geeta's finals
is against the Australian,

1723
02:13:31,084 --> 02:13:32,292
or the Scottish wrestler.

1724
02:13:32,959 --> 02:13:34,626
I'm very proud of Geeta.

1725
02:13:35,167 --> 02:13:38,126
She followed my strategy to the T.

1726
02:13:38,542 --> 02:13:40,292
The result is in front of you.

1727
02:13:41,251 --> 02:13:42,667
Here she comes.

1728
02:13:44,876 --> 02:13:46,542
She looks good.

1729
02:13:47,876 --> 02:13:49,501
I mean... as a wrestler.

1730
02:13:51,376 --> 02:13:54,709
Uncle, isn't she the
same one from the DVD?

1731
02:13:56,542 --> 02:13:58,001
Angelina Watson.

1732
02:13:58,459 --> 02:14:00,417
She's defeated Geeta twice.

1733
02:14:02,209 --> 02:14:04,292
She's played well till now.

1734
02:14:04,959 --> 02:14:06,709
And she'll play well
in the finals too.

1735
02:14:11,834 --> 02:14:14,876
I've always had faith in Geeta.

1736
02:14:15,334 --> 02:14:18,792
Sooner or later she had to
win an international medal.

1737
02:14:23,751 --> 02:14:25,542
A silver is guaranteed now!

1738
02:14:32,042 --> 02:14:33,584
The final won't be so easy.

1739
02:14:34,459 --> 02:14:35,334
Geeta-ji,

1740
02:14:35,834 --> 02:14:37,626
your game has changed dramatically.

1741
02:14:37,834 --> 02:14:39,126
How did this happen?

1742
02:14:44,376 --> 02:14:47,417
The entire credit for this,

1743
02:14:47,626 --> 02:14:49,084
goes to my father.

1744
02:14:52,667 --> 02:14:55,376
He never stopped believing in me.

1745
02:15:04,917 --> 02:15:05,792
Mahavir-ji!

1746
02:15:06,792 --> 02:15:08,292
Hello, Mr. Shamim.

1747
02:15:08,417 --> 02:15:10,084
Congratulations, Mahavir-ji!

1748
02:15:10,167 --> 02:15:11,751
Geeta fought very well.

1749
02:15:11,876 --> 02:15:14,417
All of Balali is proud.

1750
02:15:14,626 --> 02:15:15,959
And these girls insisted,

1751
02:15:16,084 --> 02:15:18,292
on watching Geeta's match
in the stadium,

1752
02:15:18,376 --> 02:15:19,584
or they won't eat.

1753
02:15:21,959 --> 02:15:23,001
How did you like the match?

1754
02:15:23,084 --> 02:15:24,292
Loved it!

1755
02:15:24,376 --> 02:15:26,459
Give this to her.

1756
02:15:27,876 --> 02:15:28,667
What is this?

1757
02:15:28,834 --> 02:15:29,917
I prayed for her.

1758
02:15:30,042 --> 02:15:31,792
Tomorrow is the final.

1759
02:15:34,917 --> 02:15:35,709
Bless you!

1760
02:15:36,126 --> 02:15:37,751
How can we allow this, sir?

1761
02:15:38,167 --> 02:15:40,834
Mahavir Singh is shouting instructions
to Geeta from the audience.

1762
02:15:41,084 --> 02:15:43,751
The poor thing is getting confused
whether to listen to him or me.

1763
02:15:45,834 --> 02:15:49,084
From her game, it sure doesn't
seem like she's confused.

1764
02:15:51,001 --> 02:15:54,334
Besides, how can we ask
the audience to remain silent?

1765
02:15:55,334 --> 02:15:56,376
Aren't you the coach?

1766
02:15:57,876 --> 02:15:59,417
She should be listening to you.

1767
02:15:59,709 --> 02:16:01,751
No, sir... she is listening to me.

1768
02:16:02,417 --> 02:16:04,751
- That's why she's winning.
- Then what's the problem?

1769
02:16:07,167 --> 02:16:08,917
You wanted a bronze, right?

1770
02:16:10,417 --> 02:16:13,459
It's quite possible that
tomorrow she may win gold.

1771
02:16:14,542 --> 02:16:15,334
No?

1772
02:16:17,376 --> 02:16:21,709
I'm surprised she's made it so far
but I am happy for her.

1773
02:16:22,001 --> 02:16:24,542
It should be an interesting
final tomorrow.

1774
02:16:24,626 --> 02:16:27,667
Playing an Indian
in front of an Indian crowd.

1775
02:16:27,959 --> 02:16:29,667
Beating her, of course!

1776
02:16:29,792 --> 02:16:32,334
Angelina, any pressure
before the finals?

1777
02:16:32,459 --> 02:16:36,209
Yeah, I'm sure she must be
under tremendous pressure.

1778
02:16:36,959 --> 02:16:38,626
I've beaten her twice.

1779
02:16:38,917 --> 02:16:40,084
- First round?
- Yeah.

1780
02:16:40,167 --> 02:16:41,667
Yeah, first round.

1781
02:16:42,334 --> 02:16:44,251
So, thank you and,

1782
02:16:44,334 --> 02:16:45,459
Namaste!

1783
02:16:51,459 --> 02:16:53,417
What's the strategy
for tomorrow, papa?

1784
02:17:01,417 --> 02:17:04,334
There is only one strategy
for tomorrow, child.

1785
02:17:05,459 --> 02:17:09,292
You have to fight in a way
that people remember you.

1786
02:17:12,501 --> 02:17:14,251
If you win silver,

1787
02:17:14,834 --> 02:17:17,459
sooner or later
you'll be forgotten.

1788
02:17:19,334 --> 02:17:23,292
If you win gold,
you will become an example.

1789
02:17:24,959 --> 02:17:28,834
And examples are given, child...
not forgotten.

1790
02:17:34,084 --> 02:17:36,167
See those girls?

1791
02:17:38,126 --> 02:17:40,667
If you win tomorrow,
you will not win alone.

1792
02:17:41,417 --> 02:17:45,126
Millions of girls like them
will win along with you.

1793
02:17:47,667 --> 02:17:51,959
It'll be a victory for every girl who
is considered inferior to boys;

1794
02:17:52,501 --> 02:17:55,042
who is forced
into household chores,

1795
02:17:55,126 --> 02:17:58,042
who is married off
to just raise children.

1796
02:18:00,667 --> 02:18:04,334
Tomorrow's match is
the most important one.

1797
02:18:07,001 --> 02:18:10,167
Because tomorrow you won't be
fighting just that Australian

1798
02:18:10,542 --> 02:18:15,084
but all those people
who think less of girls.

1799
02:18:22,917 --> 02:18:25,667
<i>The finals of the women's wrestling,
Commonwealth Games 2010,</i>

1800
02:18:25,917 --> 02:18:28,751
<i>55-kilo category, is about to begin.</i>

1801
02:18:29,084 --> 02:18:33,792
<i>India's Geeta Kumari versus
Australia's Angelina Watson.</i>

1802
02:18:34,876 --> 02:18:37,292
<i>We'd like to remind you all,</i>

1803
02:18:37,376 --> 02:18:40,917
<i>that never before has
an Indian female wrestler,</i>

1804
02:18:41,459 --> 02:18:44,459
<i>ever won gold in the
Commonwealth Games.</i>

1805
02:18:45,251 --> 02:18:47,459
<i>In this crowd, we see,</i>

1806
02:18:48,084 --> 02:18:51,667
a <i>lot of hope, enthusiasm
and the Indian flag.</i>

1807
02:19:09,042 --> 02:19:10,376
Hello, sir!

1808
02:19:10,459 --> 02:19:12,042
Aren't you Mahavir Singh-ji?

1809
02:19:12,126 --> 02:19:13,542
- Geeta's father?
- Yes.

1810
02:19:13,626 --> 02:19:14,584
A moment please.

1811
02:19:14,834 --> 02:19:18,376
The chairman of the Wrestling
Federation wants to meet you.

1812
02:19:18,459 --> 02:19:19,834
Some important matter.

1813
02:19:20,626 --> 02:19:23,126
I'll meet him later.
It's my daughter's match.

1814
02:19:23,251 --> 02:19:25,459
He's a big man.
He might get offended.

1815
02:19:25,542 --> 02:19:27,834
Just two minutes.

1816
02:19:31,334 --> 02:19:32,667
You carry on. I'll be there.

1817
02:19:38,209 --> 02:19:41,167
"The entire credit for this
goes to my father."

1818
02:19:42,042 --> 02:19:43,959
Go... take the credit.

1819
02:19:54,667 --> 02:19:55,959
How much further is it?

1820
02:19:56,042 --> 02:19:57,459
We are almost there, sir.

1821
02:20:05,042 --> 02:20:06,667
Where have you got me?

1822
02:20:08,126 --> 02:20:10,209
Hey, brother!

1823
02:20:10,501 --> 02:20:12,792
What are you doing, brother?

1824
02:20:14,959 --> 02:20:19,459
<i>A thunderous applause for Geeta
as she walks in.</i>

1825
02:20:20,292 --> 02:20:21,834
Is anyone there?

1826
02:20:24,376 --> 02:20:25,542
Hello!

1827
02:20:26,292 --> 02:20:27,876
Anyone there?

1828
02:20:28,542 --> 02:20:30,001
This is the final.

1829
02:20:30,251 --> 02:20:31,584
Play carefully.

1830
02:21:02,209 --> 02:21:06,042
<i>Angelina Watson enters the stadium.</i>

1831
02:21:17,209 --> 02:21:20,584
<i>And the final match begins.</i>

1832
02:21:20,667 --> 02:21:22,417
Go for gold, Geeta!

1833
02:21:28,626 --> 02:21:31,876
<i>Angelina, aggressive
from the start.</i>

1834
02:21:32,626 --> 02:21:34,209
<i>She attacks.</i>

1835
02:21:38,126 --> 02:21:39,209
<i>Geeta defends.</i>

1836
02:21:43,959 --> 02:21:46,084
<i>And 3 points for Geeta!</i>

1837
02:21:46,292 --> 02:21:49,542
<i>Geeta takes a big lead
right from the start.</i>

1838
02:21:50,084 --> 02:21:52,917
<i>Geeta - 3; Angelina - 0.</i>

1839
02:21:53,542 --> 02:21:54,334
Good... good!

1840
02:22:09,876 --> 02:22:11,626
<i>Another point for Geeta.</i>

1841
02:22:12,876 --> 02:22:16,209
<i>Geeta - 4; Angelina - 0.</i>

1842
02:22:16,751 --> 02:22:19,084
<i>Geeta playing very well.</i>

1843
02:22:26,376 --> 02:22:28,209
<i>Angelina will need to act fast.</i>

1844
02:22:38,167 --> 02:22:40,042
<i>1 point to Angelina.</i>

1845
02:22:41,417 --> 02:22:43,959
<i>Angelina looks for a take-down.</i>

1846
02:22:46,167 --> 02:22:47,876
<i>Geeta defends well.</i>

1847
02:22:48,334 --> 02:22:49,751
<i>Referee whistles.</i>

1848
02:22:49,876 --> 02:22:52,667
<i>Geeta leads, 4-1.</i>

1849
02:22:58,126 --> 02:23:02,542
<i>1 point to Geeta.
Geeta-5; Angelina -1.</i>

1850
02:23:03,042 --> 02:23:06,751
<i>And with this, Geeta Kumari
wins the first round quite easily.</i>

1851
02:23:06,834 --> 02:23:09,292
<i>Perhaps Angelina is realizing,</i>

1852
02:23:09,709 --> 02:23:11,209
<i>that this is not the same Geeta,</i>

1853
02:23:11,292 --> 02:23:13,542
<i>whom she had defeated
easily in the past.</i>

1854
02:23:43,251 --> 02:23:45,084
<i>And the second round starts.</i>

1855
02:23:45,251 --> 02:23:48,042
<i>Will Geeta win this round
and create history?</i>

1856
02:23:52,751 --> 02:23:54,667
<i>An excellent take-down!
1 point to Geeta.</i>

1857
02:23:54,959 --> 02:23:58,084
<i>Geeta - 1; Angelina - 0.</i>

1858
02:23:59,792 --> 02:24:01,501
Go... Geeta, go!

1859
02:24:10,459 --> 02:24:12,209
<i>2 more points for Geeta!</i>

1860
02:24:12,292 --> 02:24:15,251
<i>Geeta - 3; Angelina - 0.</i>

1861
02:24:15,334 --> 02:24:18,292
<i>Geeta bearing down on Angelina.</i>

1862
02:24:22,459 --> 02:24:24,001
<i>Geeta attacks!</i>

1863
02:24:24,792 --> 02:24:26,709
<i>1 point for Geeta.</i>

1864
02:24:27,959 --> 02:24:28,792
<i>Two more points,</i>

1865
02:24:28,876 --> 02:24:30,834
<i>and she'll win this round
by technical superiority,</i>

1866
02:24:30,917 --> 02:24:32,501
<i>and the championship!</i>

1867
02:24:33,126 --> 02:24:35,292
<i>Geeta bearing down
with all her might.</i>

1868
02:24:35,542 --> 02:24:37,417
<i>Will Geeta win?</i>

1869
02:24:39,042 --> 02:24:41,376
<i>The referee's whistle saves Angelina!</i>

1870
02:24:41,459 --> 02:24:43,042
No problem... Geeta!

1871
02:24:47,751 --> 02:24:49,709
<i>Angelina seems furious.</i>

1872
02:24:54,667 --> 02:24:58,417
<i>1 point for Angelina.
Angelina - 1; Geeta - 4.</i>

1873
02:24:58,501 --> 02:25:00,334
<i>Geeta is still in danger.</i>

1874
02:25:01,542 --> 02:25:03,376
<i>2 more points for Angelina.</i>

1875
02:25:04,501 --> 02:25:06,917
<i>Geeta - 4; Angelina - 3.</i>

1876
02:25:10,876 --> 02:25:12,459
No problem... come on!

1877
02:25:12,542 --> 02:25:14,917
<i>Geeta still leads by 1 point.</i>

1878
02:25:15,167 --> 02:25:17,959
<i>She needs to hold on to it
a little longer.</i>

1879
02:25:19,376 --> 02:25:21,542
<i>Will Geeta retain this lead?</i>

1880
02:25:23,876 --> 02:25:25,334
<i>Time is running out.</i>

1881
02:25:25,584 --> 02:25:27,084
<i>Geeta defends well.</i>

1882
02:25:27,376 --> 02:25:29,417
<i>Angelina going all out.</i>

1883
02:25:31,126 --> 02:25:33,126
<i>3 points to Angelina!</i>

1884
02:25:33,376 --> 02:25:36,001
<i>Angelina - 6; Geeta - 4.</i>

1885
02:25:40,751 --> 02:25:43,042
<i>And this round comes to an end.</i>

1886
02:25:44,959 --> 02:25:49,126
<i>And Angelina has shown
what a true champion is made of!</i>

1887
02:25:49,834 --> 02:25:52,459
What are you doing?
You could've won the match!

1888
02:26:01,542 --> 02:26:04,209
<i>Angelina, with renewed enthusiasm.</i>

1889
02:26:06,501 --> 02:26:10,876
<i>It's not going to be
easy for Geeta.</i>

1890
02:26:11,376 --> 02:26:13,751
<i>Angelina aggressive
from the start.</i>

1891
02:26:21,167 --> 02:26:24,334
<i>3 points for Angelina!</i>

1892
02:26:24,959 --> 02:26:28,251
<i>A 3-point lead in the final round!</i>

1893
02:26:29,542 --> 02:26:32,459
<i>Angelina - 3; Geeta - 0.</i>

1894
02:26:44,542 --> 02:26:46,709
<i>1 point more to Angelina.</i>

1895
02:26:47,334 --> 02:26:50,376
<i>Angelina - 4; Geeta - 0.</i>

1896
02:26:50,834 --> 02:26:54,667
<i>And this match leaning
in favour of Angelina.</i>

1897
02:26:54,959 --> 02:27:00,292
<i>If Geeta has to get back,
she needs to score fast.</i>

1898
02:27:06,376 --> 02:27:08,334
<i>A clever move by Geeta.</i>

1899
02:27:11,084 --> 02:27:13,376
<i>1 point to Geeta!</i>

1900
02:27:15,709 --> 02:27:18,834
<i>Angelina - 4; Geeta - 1.</i>

1901
02:27:19,459 --> 02:27:21,417
<i>Time... running out.</i>

1902
02:27:21,667 --> 02:27:23,751
<i>Geeta needs to keep at it.</i>

1903
02:27:23,959 --> 02:27:26,792
<i>But carefully, because if
Angelina scores again,</i>

1904
02:27:26,959 --> 02:27:29,376
<i>it'll be impossible
to make a comeback.</i>

1905
02:27:35,417 --> 02:27:36,417
<i>Geeta attacks,</i>

1906
02:27:36,501 --> 02:27:38,584
<i>but Angelina scores a point!</i>

1907
02:27:40,626 --> 02:27:43,542
<i>Angelina - 5; Geeta - 1.</i>

1908
02:27:45,042 --> 02:27:50,709
<i>It's almost impossible now
for Geeta to make a comeback!</i>

1909
02:27:59,876 --> 02:28:02,001
"Remember!"

1910
02:28:03,542 --> 02:28:06,501
"Your papa won't be there
to save you every time."

1911
02:28:07,167 --> 02:28:08,959
"I can only teach you to fight."

1912
02:28:09,084 --> 02:28:10,584
"But you have to fight yourself."

1913
02:28:10,751 --> 02:28:13,167
"Make the effort...
save yourself."

1914
02:28:20,167 --> 02:28:22,292
<i>Only 22 seconds left.</i>

1915
02:28:23,001 --> 02:28:26,292
<i>And Geeta is trailing by 4 points.</i>

1916
02:28:27,292 --> 02:28:35,084
<i>At this level, it's almost impossible
to cover this lead in such short time.</i>

1917
02:28:46,459 --> 02:28:49,834
"To score five points is difficult,

1918
02:28:51,292 --> 02:28:53,126
but it can be done."

1919
02:28:55,292 --> 02:28:57,167
<i>Geeta trying.</i>

1920
02:28:57,501 --> 02:28:59,459
<i>But Angelina stalling for time.</i>

1921
02:29:02,667 --> 02:29:05,376
<i>Just a few seconds left.</i>

1922
02:29:05,709 --> 02:29:09,959
<i>And India might have to
settle for a silver.</i>

1923
02:29:34,626 --> 02:29:37,292
"You have to play with
the opponent's mind."

1924
02:29:39,709 --> 02:29:41,709
"Fake a move,

1925
02:29:41,792 --> 02:29:43,084
but make another."

1926
02:29:50,709 --> 02:29:53,292
<i>And a fantastic move by Geeta.</i>

1927
02:29:55,417 --> 02:29:58,126
<i>Will time be on her side?</i>

1928
02:30:38,501 --> 02:30:40,459
<i>It's a gold for Geeta!</i>

1929
02:30:43,959 --> 02:30:49,126
<i>Geeta has achieved
the impossible!</i>

1930
02:30:49,542 --> 02:30:52,126
<i>She is the first ever
female Indian wrestler,</i>

1931
02:30:52,209 --> 02:30:54,834
<i>to win gold at the
Commonwealth Games!</i>

1932
02:30:56,126 --> 02:30:59,876
<i>Who would have thought that
a girl from a small village in India,</i>

1933
02:31:00,251 --> 02:31:03,584
<i>is capable of leaving her mark
on the whole world!</i>

1934
02:31:05,167 --> 02:31:06,126
<i>Well done, Geeta!</i>

1935
02:31:06,834 --> 02:31:09,751
<i>A proud moment for India indeed!</i>

1936
02:31:55,417 --> 02:31:56,626
Champion!

1937
02:31:56,751 --> 02:31:57,959
Where's papa?

1938
02:31:58,667 --> 02:31:59,626
I don't know.

1939
02:31:59,709 --> 02:32:01,126
We came together though.

1940
02:32:14,626 --> 02:32:16,417
<i>And now the gold medal,</i>

1941
02:32:16,751 --> 02:32:19,584
<i>for India's Geeta Kumari Phogat.</i>

1942
02:32:25,167 --> 02:32:27,376
<i>And now, as per tradition,</i>

1943
02:32:27,959 --> 02:32:31,334
<i>the national anthem of the
winning country will play.</i>

1944
02:33:33,001 --> 02:33:36,209
Victory to India!

1945
02:33:41,876 --> 02:33:43,792
Hey! What are you doing here?

1946
02:34:07,751 --> 02:34:11,167
Geeta, come...
the media is waiting.

1947
02:34:11,667 --> 02:34:12,501
Come.

1948
02:34:14,126 --> 02:34:15,667
Come. Everyone is waiting.

1949
02:34:17,959 --> 02:34:18,959
Come... come.

1950
02:35:19,959 --> 02:35:24,209
<i>And finally uncle uttered
those golden words,</i>

1951
02:35:24,542 --> 02:35:29,001
<i>that we had been pining to hear
for the past 10 years.</i>

1952
02:35:31,042 --> 02:35:32,876
I'm proud of you!
